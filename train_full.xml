	<utterance text="And at first , this sort of thing is unpleasant enough ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It touches one ' s sense of honour , particularly if you come of an old established family in the land , the Van Rensselaers , or Randolphs , or Hardicanutes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the tar - pot , you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster , making the tallest boys stand in awe of you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The transition is a keen one , I assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But even this wears off in time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What of it , if some old hunks of a sea - captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What does that indignity amount to , weighed , I mean , in the scales of the New Testament ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who ain ' t a slave ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tell me that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , then , however the old sea - captains may order me about -- however they may thump and punch me about , I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way -- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view , that is ; and so the universal thump is passed round , and all hands should rub each other ' s shoulder - blades , and be content ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again , I always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the contrary , passengers themselves must pay ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But BEING PAID ,-- what will compare with it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills , and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Finally , I always go to sea as a sailor , because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore - castle deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For as in this world , head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern ( that is , if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim ), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter - deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He thinks he breathes it first ; but not so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things , at the same time that the leaders little suspect it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the Fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this :" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers , the Fates , put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies , and short and easy parts in genteel comedies , and jolly parts in farces -- though I cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that I recall all the circumstances , I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises , induced me to set about performing the part I did , besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the undeliverable , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With other men , perhaps , such things would not have been inducements ; but as for me , I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I love to sail forbidden seas , and land on barbarous coasts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not ignoring what is good , I am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it -- would they let me -- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great flood - gates of the wonder - world swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my inmost soul , endless processions of the whale , and , mid most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 2" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Carpet - Bag ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet - bag , tucked it under my arm , and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Quitting the good city of old Manhatto , I duly arrived in New Bedford ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a Saturday night in December ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following Monday ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that I , for one , had no idea of so doing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft , because there was a fine , boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island , which amazingly pleased me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her , yet Nantucket was her great original -- the Tyre of this Carthage ;-- the place where the first dead American whale was stranded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen , the Red - Men , first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And where but from Nantucket , too , did that first adventurous little sloop put forth , partly laden with imported cobblestones -- so goes the story -- to throw at the whales , in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in New Bedford , ere I could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a very dubious - looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I knew no one in the place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver ,-- So , wherever you go , Ishmael , said I to myself , as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south -- wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night , my dear Ishmael , be sure to inquire the price , and don ' t be too particular ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With halting steps I paced the streets , and passed the sign of &quot; The Crossed Harpoons &quot;-- but it looked too expensive and jolly there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Further on , from the bright red windows of the &quot; Sword - Fish Inn ,&quot; there came such fervent rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , asphaltic pavement ,-- rather weary for me , when I struck my foot against the flinty projections , because from hard , remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Too expensive and jolly , again thought I , pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street , and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But go on , Ishmael , said I at last ; don ' t you hear ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So on I went ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward , for there , doubtless , were the cheapest , if not the cheeriest inns ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such dreary streets !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low , wide building , the door of which stood invitingly open ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash - box in the porch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thought I , ha , as the flying particles almost choked me , are these ashes from that destroyed city , Gomorrah ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But &quot; The Crossed Harpoons ,&quot; and &quot; The Sword - Fish ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- this , then must needs be the sign of &quot; The Trap .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within , pushed on and opened a second , interior door ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer ; and beyond , a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a negro church ; and the preacher ' s text was about the blackness of darkness , and the weeping and wailing and teeth - gnashing there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha , Ishmael , muttered I , backing out , Wretched entertainment at the sign of ' The Trap !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moving on , I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray , and these words underneath --&quot; The Spouter Inn :-- Peter Coffin .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Coffin ?-- Spouter ?-- Rather ominous in that particular connexion , thought I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it is a common name in Nantucket , they say , and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district , and as the swinging sign had a poverty - stricken sort of creak to it , I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings , and the best of pea coffee ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a queer sort of place -- a gable - ended old house , one side palsied as it were , and leaning over sadly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It stood on a sharp bleak corner , where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul ' s tossed craft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Euroclydon , nevertheless , is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in - doors , with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon ,&quot; says an old writer -- of whose works I possess the only copy extant --&quot; it maketh a marvellous difference , whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside , or whether thou observest it from that sashless window , where the frost is on both sides , and of which the wight Death is the only glazier .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="True enough , thought I , as this passage occurred to my mind -- old black - letter , thou reasonest well ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , these eyes are windows , and this body of mine is the house ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What a pity they didn ' t stop up the chinks and the crannies though , and thrust in a little lint here and there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it ' s too late to make any improvements now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The universe is finished ; the copestone is on , and the chips were carted off a million years ago ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Poor Lazarus there , chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings , he might plug up both ears with rags , and put a corn - cob into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Euroclydon !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="says old Dives , in his red silken wrapper --( he had a redder one afterwards ) pooh , pooh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What a fine frosty night ; how Orion glitters ; what northern lights !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what thinks Lazarus ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator ; yea , ye gods !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="go down to the fiery pit itself , in order to keep out this frost ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives , this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet Dives himself , he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs , and being a president of a temperance society , he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no more of this blubbering now , we are going a - whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet , and see what sort of a place this &quot; Spouter &quot; may be ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 3" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Spouter - Inn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Entering that gable - ended Spouter - Inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , straggling entry with old - fashioned wainscots , reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist , in the time of the New England hags , had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But by dint of much and earnest contemplation , and oft repeated ponderings , and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea , however wild , might not be altogether unwarranted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long , limber , portentous , black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue , dim , perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A boggy , soggy , squitchy picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet was there a sort of indefinite , half - attained , unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it , till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ever and anon a bright , but , alas , deceptive idea would dart you through .-- It ' s the Black Sea in a midnight gale .-- It ' s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements .-- It ' s a blasted heath .-- It ' s a Hyperborean winter scene .-- It ' s the breaking - up of the icebound stream of Time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture ' s midst ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="THAT once found out , and all the rest were plain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="even the great leviathan himself ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , the artist ' s design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The picture represents a Cape - Horner in a great hurricane ; the half - foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast - heads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and one was sickle - shaped , with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new - mown grass by a long - armed mower ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You shuddered as you gazed , and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death - harvesting with such a hacking , horrifying implement ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some were storied weapons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With this once long lance , now wildly elbowed , fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And that harpoon -- so like a corkscrew now -- was flung in Javan seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man , travelled full forty feet , and at last was found imbedded in the hump ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Crossing this dusky entry , and on through yon low - arched way -- cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round -- you enter the public room ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A still duskier place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft ' s cockpits , especially of such a howling night , when this corner - anchored old ark rocked so furiously ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On one side stood a long , low , shelf - like table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world ' s remotest nooks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark - looking den -- the bar -- a rude attempt at a right whale ' s head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale ' s jaw , so wide , a coach might almost drive beneath it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Within are shabby shelves , ranged round with old decanters , bottles , flasks ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed Jonah ( by which name indeed they called him ), bustles a little withered old man , who , for their money , dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though true cylinders without -- within , the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass , surround these footpads ' goblets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fill to THIS mark , and your charge is but a penny ; to THIS a penny more ; and so on to the full glass -- the Cape Horn measure , which you may gulp down for a shilling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table , examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I sought the landlord , and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room , received for answer that his house was full -- not a bed unoccupied ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But avast ,&quot; he added , tapping his forehead , &quot; you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer ' s blanket , have ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I s ' pose you are goin ' a - whalin ', so you ' d better get used to that sort of thing .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed ; that if I should ever do so , it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be , and that if he ( the landlord ) really had no other place for me , and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable , why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night , I would put up with the half of any decent man ' s blanket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I thought so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All right ; take a seat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Supper ?-- you want supper ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Supper ' ll be ready directly .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I sat down on an old wooden settle , carved all over like a bench on the Battery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack - knife , stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail , but he didn ' t make much headway , I thought ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was cold as Iceland -- no fire at all -- the landlord said he couldn ' t afford it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nothing but two dismal tallow candles , each in a winding sheet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We were fain to button up our monkey jackets , and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the fare was of the most substantial kind -- not only meat and potatoes , but dumplings ; good heavens !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="dumplings for supper !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One young fellow in a green box coat , addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; My boy ,&quot; said the landlord , &quot; you ' ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Landlord ,&quot; I whispered , &quot; that aint the harpooneer is it ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , no ,&quot; said he , looking a sort of diabolically funny , &quot; the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He never eats dumplings , he don ' t -- he eats nothing but steaks , and he likes ' em rare .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The devil he does ,&quot; says I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Where is that harpooneer ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is he here ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' ll be here afore long ,&quot; was the answer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I could not help it , but I began to feel suspicious of this &quot; dark complexioned &quot; harpooneer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At any rate , I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together , he must undress and get into bed before I did ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Supper over , the company went back to the bar - room , when , knowing not what else to do with myself , I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Presently a rioting noise was heard without ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starting up , the landlord cried , &quot; That ' s the Grampus ' s crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I seed her reported in the offing this morning ; a three years ' voyage , and a full ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hurrah , boys ; now we ' ll have the latest news from the Feegees .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry ; the door was flung open , and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats , and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters , all bedarned and ragged , and their beards stiff with icicles , they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale ' s mouth -- the bar -- when the wrinkled little old Jonah , there officiating , soon poured them out brimmers all round ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch - like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of Labrador , or on the weather side of an ice - island ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I observed , however , that one of them held somewhat aloof , and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This man interested me at once ; and since the sea - gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate ( though but a sleeping - partner one , so far as this narrative is concerned ), I will here venture upon a little description of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a coffer - dam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have seldom seen such brawn in a man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner , and from his fine stature , I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height , this man slipped away unobserved , and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a few minutes , however , he was missed by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favourite with them , they raised a cry of &quot; Bulkington !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bulkington !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="where ' s Bulkington ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and darted out of the house in pursuit of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was now about nine o ' clock , and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies , I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No man prefers to sleep two in a bed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I don ' t know how it is , but people like to be private when they are sleeping ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger , in a strange inn , in a strange town , and that stranger a harpooneer , then your objections indefinitely multiply ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than bachelor Kings do ashore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment , but you have your own hammock , and cover yourself with your own blanket , and sleep in your own skin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The more I pondered over this harpooneer , the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or woollen , as the case might be , would not be of the tidiest , certainly none of the finest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I began to twitch all over ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , it was getting late , and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Suppose now , he should tumble in upon me at midnight -- how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Landlord !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ve changed my mind about that harpooneer .-- I shan ' t sleep with him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll try the bench here .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Just as you please ; I ' m sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress , and it ' s a plaguy rough board here &quot;-- feeling of the knots and notches ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But wait a bit , Skrimshander ; I ' ve got a carpenter ' s plane there in the bar -- wait , I say , and I ' ll make ye snug enough .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench , vigorously set to planing away at my bed , the while grinning like an ape ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The shavings flew right and left ; till at last the plane - iron came bump against an indestructible knot ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The landlord was near spraining his wrist , and I told him for heaven ' s sake to quit -- the bed was soft enough to suit me , and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So gathering up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I now took the measure of the bench , and found that it was a foot too short ; but that could be mended with a chair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was a foot too narrow , and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one -- so there was no yoking them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The devil fetch that harpooneer , thought I , but stop , couldn ' t I steal a march on him -- bolt his door inside , and jump into his bed , not to be wakened by the most violent knockings ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seemed no bad idea ; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For who could tell but what the next morning , so soon as I popped out of the room , the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to knock me down !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still , looking round me again , and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person ' s bed , I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thinks I , I ' ll wait awhile ; he must be dropping in before long ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll have a good look at him then , and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all -- there ' s no telling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones , twos , and threes , and going to bed , yet no sign of my harpooneer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Landlord !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I , &quot; what sort of a chap is he -- does he always keep such late hours ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was now hard upon twelve o ' clock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle , and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No ,&quot; he answered , &quot; generally he ' s an early bird -- airley to bed and airley to rise -- yes , he ' s the bird what catches the worm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to - night he went out a peddling , you see , and I don ' t see what on airth keeps him so late , unless , may be , he can ' t sell his head .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Can ' t sell his head ?-- What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="getting into a towering rage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Do you pretend to say , landlord , that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night , or rather Sunday morning , in peddling his head around this town ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; That ' s precisely it ,&quot; said the landlord , &quot; and I told him he couldn ' t sell it here , the market ' s overstocked .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; With what ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shouted I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; With heads to be sure ; ain ' t there too many heads in the world ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I tell you what it is , landlord ,&quot; said I quite calmly , &quot; you ' d better stop spinning that yarn to me -- I ' m not green .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; May be not ,&quot; taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick , &quot; but I rayther guess you ' ll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin ' his head .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I ' ll break it for him ,&quot; said I , now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It ' s broke a ' ready ,&quot; said he ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Broke ,&quot; said I --&quot; BROKE , do you mean ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sartain , and that ' s the very reason he can ' t sell it , I guess .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Landlord ,&quot; said I , going up to him as cool as Mt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hecla in a snow - storm --&quot; landlord , stop whittling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You and I must understand one another , and that too without delay ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And about this harpooneer , whom I have not yet seen , you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow -- a sort of connexion , landlord , which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is , and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And in the first place , you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head , which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad , and I ' ve no idea of sleeping with a madman ; and you , sir , YOU I mean , landlord , YOU , sir , by trying to induce me to do so knowingly , would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Wall ,&quot; said the landlord , fetching a long breath , &quot; that ' s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But be easy , be easy , this here harpooneer I have been tellin ' you of has just arrived from the south seas , where he bought up a lot of ' balmed New Zealand heads ( great curios , you know ), and he ' s sold all on ' em but one , and that one he ' s trying to sell to - night , cause to - morrow ' s Sunday , and it would not do to be sellin ' human heads about the streets when folks is goin ' to churches ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He wanted to , last Sunday , but I stopped him just as he was goin ' out of the door with four heads strung on a string , for all the airth like a string of inions .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery , and showed that the landlord , after all , had had no idea of fooling me -- but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath , engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Depend upon it , landlord , that harpooneer is a dangerous man .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He pays reg ' lar ,&quot; was the rejoinder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But come , it ' s getting dreadful late , you had better be turning flukes -- it ' s a nice bed ; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed ; it ' s an almighty big bed that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why , afore we give it up , Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night , and somehow , Sam got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his arm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Arter that , Sal said it wouldn ' t do ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come along here , I ' ll give ye a glim in a jiffy ;&quot; and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me , offering to lead the way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I stood irresolute ; when looking at a clock in the corner , he exclaimed &quot; I vum it ' s Sunday -- you won ' t see that harpooneer to - night ; he ' s come to anchor somewhere -- come along then ; DO come ; WON ' T ye come ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I considered the matter a moment , and then up stairs we went , and I was ushered into a small room , cold as a clam , and furnished , sure enough , with a prodigious bed , almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There ,&quot; said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash - stand and centre table ; &quot; there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Folding back the counterpane , I stooped over the bed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though none of the most elegant , it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I then glanced round the room ; and besides the bedstead and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of things not properly belonging to the room , there was a hammock lashed up , and thrown upon the floor in one corner ; also a large seaman ' s bag , containing the harpooneer ' s wardrobe , no doubt in lieu of a land trunk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Likewise , there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire - place , and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what is this on the chest ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and smelt it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in South American ponchos ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I put it on , to try it , and it weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and I thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and I never saw such a sight in my life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this head - peddling harpooneer , and his door mat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After thinking some time on the bed - side , I got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But beginning to feel very cold now , half undressed as I was , and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer ' s not coming home at all that night , it being so very late , I made no more ado , but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots , and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed , and commended myself to the care of heaven ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn - cobs or broken crockery , there is no telling , but I rolled about a good deal , and could not sleep for a long time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last I slid off into a light doze , and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod , when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage , and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lord save me , thinks I , that must be the harpooneer , the infernal head - peddler ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I lay perfectly still , and resolved not to say a word till spoken to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Holding a light in one hand , and that identical New Zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag ' s mouth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This accomplished , however , he turned round -- when , good heavens !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what a sight !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such a face !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was of a dark , purplish , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , it ' s just as I thought , he ' s a terrible bedfellow ; he ' s been in a fight , got dreadfully cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that I plainly saw they could not be sticking - plasters at all , those black squares on his cheeks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were stains of some sort or other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At first I knew not what to make of this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I remembered a story of a white man -- a whaleman too -- who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I concluded that this harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages , must have met with a similar adventure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what is it , thought I , after all !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But then , what to make of his unearthly complexion , that part of it , I mean , lying round about , and completely independent of the squares of tattooing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; but I never heard of a hot sun ' s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , I had never been in the South Seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced fumbling in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a seal - skin wallet with the hair on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the New Zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He now took off his hat -- a new beaver hat -- when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp - knot twisted up on his forehead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had not the stranger stood between me and the door , I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even as it was , I thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I am no coward , but what to make of this head - peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ignorance is the parent of fear , and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger , I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , he continued the business of undressing , and at last showed his chest and arms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As I live , these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years ' War , and just escaped from it with a sticking - plaster shirt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas , and so landed in this Christian country ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I quaked to think of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A peddler of heads too -- perhaps the heads of his own brothers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He might take a fancy to mine -- heavens !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="look at that tomahawk !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Going to his heavy grego , or wrapall , or dreadnaught , which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days ' old Congo baby ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Remembering the embalmed head , at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony , I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For now the savage goes up to the empty fire - place , and removing the papered fire - board , sets up this little hunch - backed image , like a tenpin , between the andirons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty , so that I thought this fire - place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease meantime -- to see what was next to follow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp , he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Presently , after many hasty snatches into the fire , and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers ( whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly ), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing - song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last extinguishing the fire , he took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness , and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations , and jumping into bed with me , I thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which I had so long been bound ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say , was a fatal one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Taking up his tomahawk from the table , he examined the head of it for an instant , and then holding it to the light , with his mouth at the handle , he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The next moment the light was extinguished , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I sang out , I could not help it now ; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stammering out something , I knew not what , I rolled away from him against the wall , and then conjured him , whoever or whatever he might be , to keep quiet , and let me get up and light the lamp again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Who - e debel you ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- he at last said --&quot; you no speak - e , dam - me , I kill - e .&quot; And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Landlord , for God ' s sake , Peter Coffin !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shouted I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Landlord !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Watch !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Coffin !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Angels !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="save me !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Speak - e !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="tell - ee me who - ee be , or dam - me , I kill - e !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="again growled the cannibal , while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But thank heaven , at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand , and leaping from the bed I ran up to him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Don ' t be afraid now ,&quot; said he , grinning again , &quot; Queequeg here wouldn ' t harm a hair of your head .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stop your grinning ,&quot; shouted I , &quot; and why didn ' t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I thought ye know ' d it ;-- didn ' t I tell ye , he was a peddlin ' heads around town ?-- but turn flukes again and go to sleep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg , look here -- you sabbee me , I sabbee -- you this man sleepe you -- you sabbee ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Me sabbee plenty &quot;-- grunted Queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; You gettee in ,&quot; he added , motioning to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I stood looking at him a moment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean , comely looking cannibal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s all this fuss I have been making about , thought I to myself -- the man ' s a human being just as I am : he has just as much reason to fear me , as I have to be afraid of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Landlord ,&quot; said I , &quot; tell him to stash his tomahawk there , or pipe , or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop smoking , in short , and I will turn in with him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I don ' t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s dangerous ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , I ain ' t insured .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This being told to Queequeg , he at once complied , and again politely motioned me to get into bed -- rolling over to one side as much as to say -- I won ' t touch a leg of ye .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Good night , landlord ,&quot; said I , &quot; you may go .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I turned in , and never slept better in my life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 4" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Counterpane ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon waking next morning about daylight , I found Queequeg ' s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You had almost thought I had been his wife ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti - coloured squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his , I say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke , I could hardly tell it from the quilt , they so blended their hues together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My sensations were strange ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let me try to explain them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When I was a child , I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , I never could entirely settle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The circumstance was this ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I had been cutting up some caper or other -- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless ,-- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o ' clock in the afternoon of the 21st June , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I felt dreadfully ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there was no help for it , so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor , undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sixteen hours in bed !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the small of my back ached to think of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And it was so light too ; the sun shining in at the window , and a great rattling of coaches in the streets , and the sound of gay voices all over the house ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I felt worse and worse -- at last I got up , dressed , and softly going down in my stockinged feet , sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers , and back I had to go to my room ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For several hours I lay there broad awake , feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since , even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly waking from it -- half steeped in dreams -- I opened my eyes , and the before sun - lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame ; nothing was to be seen , and nothing was to be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My arm hung over the counterpane , and the nameless , unimaginable , silent form or phantom , to which the hand belonged , seemed closely seated by my bed - side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For what seemed ages piled on ages , I lay there , frozen with the most awful fears , not daring to drag away my hand ; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch , the horrid spell would be broken ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; but waking in the morning , I shudderingly remembered it all , and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nay , to this very hour , I often puzzle myself with it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , take away the awful fear , and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness , to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg ' s pagan arm thrown round me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at length all the past night ' s events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For though I tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I now strove to rouse him --&quot; Queequeg !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- but his only answer was a snore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse - collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage ' s side , as if it were a hatchet - faced baby ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A pretty pickle , truly , thought I ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg !-- in the name of goodness , Queequeg , wake !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At length , by dint of much wriggling , and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style , I succeeded in extracting a grunt ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a pike - staff , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , I lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , reconciled to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thinks I , Queequeg , under the circumstances , this is a very civilized overture ; but , the truth is , these savages have an innate sense of delicacy , say what you will ; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg , because he treated me with so much civility and consideration , while I was guilty of great rudeness ; staring at him from the bed , and watching all his toilette motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , a man like Queequeg you don ' t see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then -- still minus his trowsers -- he hunted up his boots ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What under the heavens he did it for , I cannot tell , but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand , and hat on -- under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , I inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage -- neither caterpillar nor butterfly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His education was not yet completed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was an undergraduate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began creaking and limping about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled cowhide ones -- probably not made to order either -- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; I begged him as well as I could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He complied , and then proceeded to wash himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face ; but Queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash - stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thinks I , Queequeg , this is using Rogers ' s best cutlery with a vengeance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The rest of his toilet was soon achieved , and he proudly marched out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a marshal ' s baton ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 5" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Breakfast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar - room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I cherished no malice towards him , though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more ' s the pity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The bar - room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom I had not as yet had a good look at ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This young fellow ' s healthy cheek is like a sun - toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But who could show a cheek like Queequeg ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="which , barred with various tints , seemed like the Andes ' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Grub , ho !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite self - possessed in company ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not always , though : Ledyard , the great New England traveller , and Mungo Park , the Scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of Africa , which was the sum of poor Mungo ' s performances -- this kind of travel , I say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And not only that , but they looked embarrassed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , here were a set of sea - dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as for Queequeg -- why , Queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But THAT was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people ' s estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We will not speak of all Queequeg ' s peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk - pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when I sallied out for a stroll ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 6" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Street ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town , that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In thoroughfares nigh the docks , any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets , Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays ; and at Bombay , in the Apollo Green , live Yankees have often scared the natives ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In these last - mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in New Bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It makes a stranger stare ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , besides the Feegeeans , Tongatobooarrs , Erromanggoans , Pannangians , and Brighggians , and , besides the wild specimens of the whaling - craft which unheeded reel about the streets , you will see other sights still more curious , certainly more comical ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men , all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They are mostly young , of stalwart frames ; fellows who have felled forests , and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale - lance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In some things you would think them but a few hours old ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that chap strutting round the corner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He wears a beaver hat and swallow - tailed coat , girdled with a sailor - belt and sheath - knife ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here comes another with a sou '- wester and a bombazine cloak ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No town - bred dandy will compare with a country - bred one -- I mean a downright bumpkin dandy -- a fellow that , in the dog - days , will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and joins the great whale - fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In bespeaking his sea - outfit , he orders bell - buttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah , poor Hay - Seed !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not at all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still New Bedford is a queer place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had it not been for us whalemen , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As it is , parts of her back country are enough to frighten one , they look so bony ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all New England ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a land of oil , true enough : but not like Canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring - time do they pave them with fresh eggs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all America will you find more patrician - like houses ; parks and gardens more opulent , than in New Bedford ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whence came they ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion , and your question will be answered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes ; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One and all , they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In New Bedford , fathers , they say , give whales for dowers to their daughters , and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a - piece ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding ; for , they say , they have reservoirs of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples -- long avenues of green and gold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And in August , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse - chestnuts , candelabra - wise , proffer the passer - by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation ' s final day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And the women of New Bedford , they bloom like their own red roses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye cannot , save in Salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 7" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Chapel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman ' s Chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific , who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I am sure that I did not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Returning from my first morning stroll , I again sallied out upon this special errand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin , I fought my way against the stubborn storm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Entering , I found a small scattered congregation of sailors , and sailors ' wives and widows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A muffled silence reigned , only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other , as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets , with black borders , masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Three of them ran something like the following , but I do not pretend to quote :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT , Who , at the age of eighteen , was lost overboard , Near the Isle of Desolation , off Patagonia , November 1st , 1836 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="_____________" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG , WILLIS ELLERY , NATHAN COLEMAN , WALTER CANNY , SETH MACY , AND SAMUEL GLEIG , Forming one of the boats ' crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale , On the Off - shore Ground in the PACIFIC , December 31st , 1839 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="_____________" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY , Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan , AUGUST 3d , 1833 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shaking off the sleet from my ice - glazed hat and jacket , I seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Affected by the solemnity of the scene , there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , I knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief , that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those , in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say -- here , HERE lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What bitter blanks in those black - bordered marbles which cover no ashes !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What despair in those immovable inscriptions !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In what census of living creatures , the dead of mankind are included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of them , that they tell no tales , though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands ; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world , we prefix so significant and infidel a word , and yet do not thus entitle him , if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth ; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death - forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal , unstirring paralysis , and deadly , hopeless trance , yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All these things are not without their meanings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Faith , like a jackal , feeds among the tombs , and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It needs scarcely to be told , with what feelings , on the eve of a Nantucket voyage , I regarded those marble tablets , and by the murky light of that darkened , doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , Ishmael , the same fate may be thine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But somehow I grew merry again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Delightful inducements to embark , fine chance for promotion , it seems -- aye , a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , there is death in this business of whaling -- a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what then ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Methinks that in looking at things spiritual , we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water , and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact take my body who will , take it I say , it is not me ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="CHAPTER 8" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pulpit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm - pelted door flew back upon admitting him , a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation , sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , it was the famous Father Mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth , but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the time I now write of , Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth , for among all the fissures of his wrinkles , there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom -- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February ' s snow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him , imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like most old fashioned pulpits , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , seriously contract the already small area of the chapel , the architect , it seemed , had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , substituting a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man - ropes for this ladder , which , being itself nicely headed , and stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man - ropes , Father Mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor - like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main - top of his vessel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth - covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , thought I , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of God , this pulpit , I see , is a self - containing stronghold -- a lofty Ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain ' s former sea - farings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But high above the flying scud and dark - rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel ' s face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship ' s tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory ' s plank where Nelson fell ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ah , noble ship ,&quot; the angel seemed to say , &quot; beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy helm ; for lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling off -- serenest azure is at hand .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea - taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship ' s bluff bows , and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work , fashioned after a ship ' s fiddle - headed beak ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What could be more full of meaning ?-- for the pulpit is ever this earth ' s foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From thence it is the storm of God ' s quick wrath is first descried , and the bow must bear the earliest brunt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , the world ' s a ship on its passage out , and not a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 9" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Sermon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Father Mapple rose , and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Starboard gangway , there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="side away to larboard -- larboard gangway to starboard !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Midships !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="midships !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was a low rumbling of heavy sea - boots among the benches , and a still slighter shuffling of women ' s shoes , and all was quiet again , and every eye on the preacher ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit ' s bows , folded his large brown hands across his chest , uplifted his closed eyes , and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This ended , in prolonged solemn tones , like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog -- in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas , burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy --" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The ribs and terrors in the whale , Arched over me a dismal gloom , While all God ' s sun - lit waves rolled by , And lift me deepening down to doom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I saw the opening maw of hell , With endless pains and sorrows there ; Which none but they that feel can tell -- Oh , I was plunging to despair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In black distress , I called my God , When I could scarce believe him mine , He bowed his ear to my complaints -- No more the whale did me confine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; With speed he flew to my relief , As on a radiant dolphin borne ; Awful , yet bright , as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; My song for ever shall record That terrible , that joyful hour ; I give the glory to my God , His all the mercy and the power ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nearly all joined in singing this hymn , which swelled high above the howling of the storm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible , and at last , folding his hand down upon the proper page , said : &quot; Beloved shipmates , clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah --' And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah .'&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Shipmates , this book , containing only four chapters -- four yarns -- is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah ' s deep sealine sound !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish ' s belly !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How billow - like and boisterously grand !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We feel the floods surging over us ; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters ; sea - weed and all the slime of the sea is about us !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shipmates , it is a two - stranded lesson ; a lesson to us all as sinful men , and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As sinful men , it is a lesson to us all , because it is a story of the sin , hard - heartedness , suddenly awakened fears , the swift punishment , repentance , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God -- never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed -- which he found a hard command ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if we obey God , we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this disobeying ourselves , wherein the hardness of obeying God consists ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; With this sin of disobedience in him , Jonah still further flouts at God , by seeking to flee from Him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign , but only the Captains of this earth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He skulks about the wharves of Joppa , and seeks a ship that ' s bound for Tarshish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There lurks , perhaps , a hitherto unheeded meaning here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ' s the opinion of learned men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And where is Cadiz , shipmates ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Cadiz is in Spain ; as far by water , from Joppa , as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days , when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because Joppa , the modern Jaffa , shipmates , is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean , the Syrian ; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that , just outside the Straits of Gibraltar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See ye not then , shipmates , that Jonah sought to flee world - wide from God ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Miserable man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with slouched hat and guilty eye , skulking from his God ; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So disordered , self - condemning is his look , that had there been policemen in those days , Jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been arrested ere he touched a deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How plainly he ' s a fugitive !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="no baggage , not a hat - box , valise , or carpet - bag ,-- no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last , after much dodging search , he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods , to mark the stranger ' s evil eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jonah sees this ; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence ; in vain essays his wretched smile ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In their gamesome but still serious way , one whispers to the other --&quot; Jack , he ' s robbed a widow ;&quot; or , &quot; Joe , do you mark him ; he ' s a bigamist ;&quot; or , &quot; Harry lad , I guess he ' s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah , or belike , one of the missing murderers from Sodom .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Another runs to read the bill that ' s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored , offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide , and containing a description of his person ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He reads , and looks from Jonah to the bill ; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah , prepared to lay their hands upon him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Frighted Jonah trembles , and summoning all his boldness to his face , only looks so much the more a coward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He will not confess himself suspected ; but that itself is strong suspicion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So he makes the best of it ; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised , they let him pass , and he descends into the cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Who ' s there ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cries the Captain at his busy desk , hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs --' Who ' s there ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how that harmless question mangles Jonah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the instant he almost turns to flee again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he rallies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish ; how soon sail ye , sir ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a scrutinizing glance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' We sail with the next coming tide ,' at last he slowly answered , still intently eyeing him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' No sooner , sir ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="--' Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jonah , that ' s another stab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' I ' ll sail with ye ,'-- he says ,--' the passage money how much is that ?-- I ' ll pay now .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For it is particularly written , shipmates , as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history , ' that he paid the fare thereof ' ere the craft did sail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And taken with the context , this is full of meaning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Now Jonah ' s Captain , shipmates , was one whose discernment detects crime in any , but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this world , shipmates , sin that pays its way can travel freely , and without a passport ; whereas Virtue , if a pauper , is stopped at all frontiers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So Jonah ' s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah ' s purse , ere he judge him openly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He charges him thrice the usual sum ; and it ' s assented to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive ; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse , prudent suspicions still molest the Captain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He rings every coin to find a counterfeit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not a forger , any way , he mutters ; and Jonah is put down for his passage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Point out my state - room , Sir ,' says Jonah now , ' I ' m travel - weary ; I need sleep .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Thou lookest like it ,' says the Captain , ' there ' s thy room .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jonah enters , and would lock the door , but the lock contains no key ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hearing him foolishly fumbling there , the Captain laughs lowly to himself , and mutters something about the doors of convicts ' cells being never allowed to be locked within ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All dressed and dusty as he is , Jonah throws himself into his berth , and finds the little state - room ceiling almost resting on his forehead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The air is close , and Jonah gasps ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship ' s water - line , Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels ' wards ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Screwed at its axis against the side , a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah ' s room ; and the ship , heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received , the lamp , flame and all , though in slight motion , still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room ; though , in truth , infallibly straight itself , it but made obvious the false , lying levels among which it hung ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah ; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place , and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The floor , the ceiling , and the side , are all awry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="so my conscience hangs in me !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he groans , ' straight upwards , so it burns ; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed , still reeling , but with conscience yet pricking him , as the plungings of the Roman race - horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish , praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels , a deep stupor steals over him , as over the man who bleeds to death , for conscience is the wound , and there ' s naught to staunch it ; so , after sore wrestlings in his berth , Jonah ' s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts off her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish , all careening , glides to sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ship , my friends , was the first of recorded smugglers !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the contraband was Jonah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the sea rebels ; he will not bear the wicked burden ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah ' s head ; in all this raging tumult , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , shipmates , Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship -- a berth in the cabin as I have taken it , and was fast asleep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , ' What meanest thou , O , sleeper !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="arise !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry , Jonah staggers to his feet , and stumbling to the deck , grasps a shroud , to look out upon the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And ever , as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead , aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward , but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In all his cringing attitudes , the God - fugitive is now too plainly known ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sailors mark him ; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him , and at last , fully to test the truth , by referring the whole matter to high Heaven , they fall to casting lots , to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The lot is Jonah ' s ; that discovered , then how furiously they mob him with their questions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' What is thine occupation ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whence comest thou ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thy country ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What people ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But mark now , my shipmates , the behavior of poor Jonah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The eager mariners but ask him who he is , and where from ; whereas , they not only receive an answer to those questions , but likewise another answer to a question not put by them , but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' I am a Hebrew ,' he cries -- and then --' I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fear him , O Jonah ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Straightway , he now goes on to make a full confession ; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled , but still are pitiful ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For when Jonah , not yet supplicating God for mercy , since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts ,-- when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea , for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest was upon them ; they mercifully turn from him , and seek by other means to save the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all in vain ; the indignant gale howls louder ; then , with one hand raised invokingly to God , with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east , and the sea is still , as Jonah carries down the gale with him , leaving smooth water behind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him ; and the whale shoots - to all his ivory teeth , like so many white bolts , upon his prison ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish ' s belly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But observe his prayer , and learn a weighty lesson ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For sinful as he is , Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He feels that his dreadful punishment is just ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He leaves all his deliverance to God , contenting himself with this , that spite of all his pains and pangs , he will still look towards His holy temple ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And here , shipmates , is true and faithful repentance ; not clamorous for pardon , but grateful for punishment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah , is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shipmates , I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sin not ; but if you do , take heed to repent of it like Jonah .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While he was speaking these words , the howling of the shrieking , slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher , who , when describing Jonah ' s sea - storm , seemed tossed by a storm himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His deep chest heaved as with a ground - swell ; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work ; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow , and the light leaping from his eye , made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There now came a lull in his look , as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more ; and , at last , standing motionless , with closed eyes , for the moment , seemed communing with God and himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But again he leaned over towards the people , and bowing his head lowly , with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility , he spake these words :" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Shipmates , God has laid but one hand upon you ; both his hands press upon me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners ; and therefore to ye , and still more to me , for I am a greater sinner than ye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now how gladly would I come down from this mast - head and sit on the hatches there where you sit , and listen as you listen , while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME , as a pilot of the living God ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How being an anointed pilot - prophet , or speaker of true things , and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh , Jonah , appalled at the hostility he should raise , fled from his mission , and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But God is everywhere ; Tarshish he never reached ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As we have seen , God came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom , and with swift slantings tore him along ' into the midst of the seas ,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and ' the weeds were wrapped about his head ,' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet --' out of the belly of hell '-- when the whale grounded upon the ocean ' s utmost bones , even then , God heard the engulphed , repenting prophet when he cried ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then God spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea , the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun , and all the delights of air and earth ; and ' vomited out Jonah upon the dry land ;' when the word of the Lord came a second time ; and Jonah , bruised and beaten -- his ears , like two sea - shells , still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean -- Jonah did the Almighty ' s bidding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what was that , shipmates ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That was it !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; This , shipmates , this is that other lesson ; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Woe to him who , in this world , courts not dishonour !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Woe to him who would not be true , even though to be false were salvation !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yea , woe to him who , as the great Pilot Paul has it , while preaching to others is himself a castaway !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment ; then lifting his face to them again , showed a deep joy in his eyes , as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm ,--&quot; But oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shipmates !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="on the starboard hand of every woe , there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that delight , than the bottom of the woe is deep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is not the main - truck higher than the kelson is low ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Delight is to him -- a far , far upward , and inward delight -- who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth , ever stands forth his own inexorable self ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him , when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Delight is to him , who gives no quarter in the truth , and kills , burns , and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Delight ,-- top - gallant delight is to him , who acknowledges no law or lord , but the Lord his God , and is only a patriot to heaven ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Delight is to him , whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath -- O Father !-- chiefly known to me by Thy rod -- mortal or immortal , here I die ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have striven to be Thine , more than to be this world ' s , or mine own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet this is nothing : I leave eternity to Thee ; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He said no more , but slowly waving a benediction , covered his face with his hands , and so remained kneeling , till all the people had departed , and he was left alone in the place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 10" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A Bosom Friend ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Returning to the Spouter - Inn from the Chapel , I found Queequeg there quite alone ; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was sitting on a bench before the fire , with his feet on the stove hearth , and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his ; peering hard into its face , and with a jack - knife gently whittling away at its nose , meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But being now interrupted , he put up the image ; and pretty soon , going to the table , took up a large book there , and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity ; at every fiftieth page -- as I fancied -- stopping a moment , looking vacantly around him , and giving utterance to a long - drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He would then begin again at the next fifty ; seeming to commence at number one each time , as though he could not count more than fifty , and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together , that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With much interest I sat watching him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Savage though he was , and hideously marred about the face -- at least to my taste -- his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You cannot hide the soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Through all his unearthly tattooings , I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart ; and in his large , deep eyes , fiery black and bold , there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And besides all this , there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan , which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether it was , too , that his head being shaved , his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief , and looked more expansive than it otherwise would , this I will not venture to decide ; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of General Washington ' s head , as seen in the popular busts of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows , which were likewise very projecting , like two long promontories thickly wooded on top ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whilst I was thus closely scanning him , half - pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement , he never heeded my presence , never troubled himself with so much as a single glance ; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous , and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning , I thought this indifference of his very strange ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But savages are strange beings ; at times you do not know exactly how to take them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At first they are overawing ; their calm self - collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all , or but very little , with the other seamen in the inn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He made no advances whatever ; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All this struck me as mighty singular ; yet , upon second thoughts , there was something almost sublime in it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home , by the way of Cape Horn , that is -- which was the only way he could get there -- thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter ; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease ; preserving the utmost serenity ; content with his own companionship ; always equal to himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , perhaps , to be true philosophers , we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher , I conclude that , like the dyspeptic old woman , he must have &quot; broken his digester .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As I sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burning low , in that mild stage when , after its first intensity has warmed the air , it then only glows to be looked at ; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements , and peering in upon us silent , solitary twain ; the storm booming without in solemn swells ; I began to be sensible of strange feelings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I felt a melting in me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This soothing savage had redeemed it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There he sat , his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wild he was ; a very sight of sights to see ; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And those same things that would have repelled most others , they were the very magnets that thus drew me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll try a pagan friend , thought I , since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I drew my bench near him , and made some friendly signs and hints , doing my best to talk with him meanwhile ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At first he little noticed these advances ; but presently , upon my referring to his last night ' s hospitalities , he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I told him yes ; whereat I thought he looked pleased , perhaps a little complimented ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We then turned over the book together , and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus I soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon I proposed a social smoke ; and , producing his pouch and tomahawk , he quietly offered me a puff ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan ' s breast , this pleasant , genial smoke we had , soon thawed it out , and left us cronies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him ; and when our smoke was over , he pressed his forehead against mine , clasped me round the waist , and said that henceforth we were married ; meaning , in his country ' s phrase , that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly die for me , if need should be ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a countryman , this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature , a thing to be much distrusted ; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco wallet , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers ' pockets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I let them stay ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper fireboard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By certain signs and symptoms , I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , I deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , I would comply or otherwise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what is worship ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thought I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you suppose now , Ishmael , that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Impossible !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what is worship ?-- to do the will of God -- THAT is worship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what is the will of God ?-- to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me -- THAT is the will of God ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , Queequeg is my fellow man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why , unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consequently , I must then unite with him in his ; ergo , I must turn idolator ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So I kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; salamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; and that done , we undressed and went to bed , at peace with our own consciences and all the world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But we did not go to sleep without some little chat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , then , in our hearts ' honeymoon , lay I and Queequeg -- a cosy , loving pair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 11" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nightgown ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We had lain thus in bed , chatting and napping at short intervals , and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine , and then drawing them back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we ; when , at last , by reason of our confabulations , what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed , and we felt like getting up again , though day - break was yet some way down the future ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , we became very wakeful ; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome , and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes well tucked around us , leaning against the head - board with our four knees drawn up close together , and our two noses bending over them , as if our kneepans were warming - pans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We felt very nice and snug , the more so since it was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed - clothes too , seeing that there was no fire in the room ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The more so , I say , because truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nothing exists in itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable , and have been so a long time , then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if , like Queequeg and me in the bed , the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time , when all at once I thought I would open my eyes ; for when between sheets , whether by day or by night , and whether asleep or awake , I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut , in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences , though light be more congenial to our clayey part ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and self - created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve - o ' clock - at - night , I experienced a disagreeable revulsion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light , seeing that we were so wide awake ; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be it said , that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before , yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord ' s policy of insurance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke , illuminated by the flame of the new - lit lamp ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , I know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , I begged him to go on and tell it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He gladly complied ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words , yet subsequent disclosures , when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology , now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 12" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Biographical ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko , an island far away to the West and South ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is not down in any map ; true places never are ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When a new - hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout , followed by the nibbling goats , as if he were a green sapling ; even then , in Queequeg ' s ambitious soul , lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His father was a High Chief , a King ; his uncle a High Priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was excellent blood in his veins -- royal stuff ; though sadly vitiated , I fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A Sag Harbor ship visited his father ' s bay , and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the King his father ' s influence could prevail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Queequeg vowed a vow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Alone in his canoe , he paddled off to a distant strait , which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On one side was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hiding his canoe , still afloat , among these thickets , with its prow seaward , he sat down in the stern , paddle low in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by , like a flash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed up the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck , grappled a ring - bolt there , and swore not to let it go , though hacked in pieces ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists ; Queequeg was the son of a King , and Queequeg budged not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Struck by his desperate dauntlessness , and his wild desire to visit Christendom , the captain at last relented , and told him he might make himself at home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this fine young savage -- this sea Prince of Wales , never saw the Captain ' s cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They put him down among the sailors , and made a whaleman of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities , Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy , if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For at bottom -- so he told me -- he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians , the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were ; and more than that , still better than they were ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , alas !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father ' s heathens ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to Nantucket , and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also , poor Queequeg gave it up for lost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thought he , it ' s a wicked world in all meridians ; I ' ll die a pagan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus an old idolator at heart , he yet lived among these Christians , wore their clothes , and tried to talk their gibberish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hence the queer ways about him , though now some time from home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By hints , I asked him whether he did not propose going back , and having a coronation ; since he might now consider his father dead and gone , he being very old and feeble at the last accounts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He answered no , not yet ; and added that he was fearful Christianity , or rather Christians , had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But by and by , he said , he would return ,-- as soon as he felt himself baptized again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the nonce , however , he proposed to sail about , and sow his wild oats in all four oceans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They had made a harpooneer of him , and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I asked him what might be his immediate purpose , touching his future movements ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He answered , to go to sea again , in his old vocation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this , I told him that whaling was my own design , and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket , as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He at once resolved to accompany me to that island , ship aboard the same vessel , get into the same watch , the same boat , the same mess with me , in short to share my every hap ; with both my hands in his , boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To all this I joyously assented ; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg , he was an experienced harpooneer , and as such , could not fail to be of great usefulness to one , who , like me , was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling , though well acquainted with the sea , as known to merchant seamen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His story being ended with his pipe ' s last dying puff , Queequeg embraced me , pressed his forehead against mine , and blowing out the light , we rolled over from each other , this way and that , and very soon were sleeping ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 13" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wheelbarrow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next morning , Monday , after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber , for a block , I settled my own and comrade ' s bill ; using , however , my comrade ' s money ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The grinning landlord , as well as the boarders , seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg -- especially as Peter Coffin ' s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We borrowed a wheelbarrow , and embarking our things , including my own poor carpet - bag , and Queequeg ' s canvas sack and hammock , away we went down to &quot; the Moss ,&quot; the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As we were going along the people stared ; not at Queequeg so much -- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets ,-- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore , and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To this , in substance , he replied , that though what I hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal combat , and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In short , like many inland reapers and mowers , who go into the farmers ' meadows armed with their own scythes -- though in no wise obliged to furnish them -- even so , Queequeg , for his own private reasons , preferred his own harpoon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shifting the barrow from my hand to his , he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was in Sag Harbor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The owners of his ship , it seems , had lent him one , in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not to seem ignorant about the thing -- though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow -- Queequeg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why ,&quot; said I , &quot; Queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Didn ' t the people laugh ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this , he told me another story ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The people of his island of Rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko , and its commander -- from all accounts , a very stately punctilious gentleman , at least for a sea captain -- this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg ' s sister , a pretty young princess just turned of ten ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well ; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride ' s bamboo cottage , this Captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honour , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the High Priest and his majesty the King , Queequeg ' s father ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Grace being said ,-- for those people have their grace as well as we -- though Queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts -- Grace , I say , being said , the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing himself placed next the Priest , and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself -- being Captain of a ship -- as having plain precedence over a mere island King , especially in the King ' s own house -- the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl ;-- taking it I suppose for a huge finger - glass ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Now ,&quot; said Queequeg , &quot; what you tink now ?-- Didn ' t our people laugh ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last , passage paid , and luggage safe , we stood on board the schooner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hoisting sail , it glided down the Acushnet river ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On one side , New Bedford rose in terraces of streets , their ice - covered trees all glittering in the clear , cold air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves , and side by side the world - wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers , with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch , all betokening that new cruises were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such is the endlessness , yea , the intolerableness of all earthly effort ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his snortings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How I snuffed that Tartar air !-- how I spurned that turnpike earth !-- that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs ; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the same foam - fountain , Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he showed his filed and pointed teeth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On , on we flew ; and our offing gained , the Moss did homage to the blast ; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sideways leaning , we sideways darted ; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers , a lubber - like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable ; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there were some boobies and bumpkins there , who , by their intense greenness , must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I thought the bumpkin ' s hour of doom was come ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dropping his harpoon , the brawny savage caught him in his arms , and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength , sent him high up bodily into the air ; then slightly tapping his stern in mid - somerset , the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet , while Queequeg , turning his back upon him , lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Capting !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Capting !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="yelled the bumpkin , running towards that officer ; &quot; Capting , Capting , here ' s the devil .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hallo , YOU sir ,&quot; cried the Captain , a gaunt rib of the sea , stalking up to Queequeg , &quot; what in thunder do you mean by that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t you know you might have killed that chap ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What him say ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Queequeg , as he mildly turned to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He say ,&quot; said I , &quot; that you came near kill - e that man there ,&quot; pointing to the still shivering greenhorn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Kill - e ,&quot; cried Queequeg , twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain , &quot; ah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="him bevy small - e fish - e ; Queequeg no kill - e so small - e fish - e ; Queequeg kill - e big whale !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look you ,&quot; roared the Captain , &quot; I ' ll kill - e YOU , you cannibal , if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; so mind your eye .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it so happened just then , that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The prodigious strain upon the main - sail had parted the weather - sheet , and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side , completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly , was swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it , seemed madness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It flew from right to left , and back again , almost in one ticking of a watch , and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the midst of this consternation , Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees , and crawling under the path of the boom , whipped hold of a rope , secured one end to the bulwarks , and then flinging the other like a lasso , caught it round the boom as it swept over his head , and at the next jerk , the spar was that way trapped , and all was safe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The schooner was run into the wind , and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat , Queequeg , stripped to the waist , darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog , throwing his long arms straight out before him , and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The greenhorn had gone down ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water , Queequeg , now took an instant ' s glance around him , and seeming to see just how matters were , dived down and disappeared ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The boat soon picked them up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The poor bumpkin was restored ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump ; the captain begged his pardon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle ; yea , till poor Queequeg took his last long dive ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Was there ever such unconsciousness ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He only asked for water -- fresh water -- something to wipe the brine off ; that done , he put on dry clothes , lighted his pipe , and leaning against the bulwarks , and mildly eyeing those around him , seemed to be saying to himself --&quot; It ' s a mutual , joint - stock world , in all meridians ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Nantucket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning ; so , after a fine run , we safely arrived in Nantucket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nantucket !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Take out your map and look at it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look at it -- a mere hillock , and elbow of sand ; all beach , without a background ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there , they don ' t grow naturally ; that they import Canada thistles ; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask ; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome ; that people there plant toadstools before their houses , to get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade of grass makes an oasis , three blades in a day ' s walk a prairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes , something like Laplander snow - shoes ; that they are so shut up , belted about , every way inclosed , surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean , that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering , as to the backs of sea turtles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red - men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus goes the legend ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast , and carried off an infant Indian in his talons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They resolved to follow in the same direction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Setting out in their canoes , after a perilous passage they discovered the island , and there they found an empty ivory casket ,-- the poor little Indian ' s skeleton ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What wonder , then , that these Nantucketers , born on a beach , should take to the sea for a livelihood !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand ; grown bolder , they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more experienced , they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; and at last , launching a navy of great ships on the sea , explored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it ; peeped in at Behring ' s Straits ; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood ; most monstrous and most mountainous !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That Himmalehan , salt - sea Mastodon , clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power , that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus have these naked Nantucketers , these sea hermits , issuing from their ant - hill in the sea , overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders ; parcelling out among them the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans , as the three pirate powers did Poland ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let America add Mexico to Texas , and pile Cuba upon Canada ; let the English overswarm all India , and hang out their blazing banner from the sun ; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the sea is his ; he owns it , as Emperors own empires ; other seamen having but a right of way through it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Merchant ships are but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; even pirates and privateers , though following the sea as highwaymen the road , they but plunder other ships , other fragments of the land like themselves , without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Nantucketer , he alone resides and riots on the sea ; he alone , in Bible language , goes down to it in ships ; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="THERE is his home ; THERE lies his business , which a Noah ' s flood would not interrupt , though it overwhelmed all the millions in China ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He lives on the sea , as prairie cocks in the prairie ; he hides among the waves , he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For years he knows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last , it smells like another world , more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With the landless gull , that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows ; so at nightfall , the Nantucketer , out of sight of land , furls his sails , and lays him to his rest , while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 15" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Chowder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor , and Queequeg and I went ashore ; so we could attend to no business that day , at least none but a supper and a bed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The landlord of the Spouter - Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots , whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket , and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea , as he called him , was famous for his chowders ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In short , he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot - luck at the Try Pots ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard , and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard , and that done , then ask the first man we met where the place was : these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first , especially as , at the outset , Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse -- our first point of departure -- must be left on the larboard hand , whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , by dint of beating about a little in the dark , and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way , we at last came to something which there was no mistaking ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Two enormous wooden pots painted black , and suspended by asses ' ears , swung from the cross - trees of an old top - mast , planted in front of an old doorway ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The horns of the cross - trees were sawed off on the other side , so that this old top - mast looked not a little like a gallows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time , but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes , TWO of them , one for Queequeg , and one for me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s ominous , thinks I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port ; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen ' s chapel ; and here a gallows !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and a pair of prodigious black pots too !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown , standing in the porch of the inn , under a dull red lamp swinging there , that looked much like an injured eye , and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Get along with ye ,&quot; said she to the man , &quot; or I ' ll be combing ye !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Come on , Queequeg ,&quot; said I , &quot; all right ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s Mrs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hussey .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so it turned out ; Mr . Hosea Hussey being from home , but leaving Mrs . Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed , Mrs . Hussey , postponing further scolding for the present , ushered us into a little room , and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast , turned round to us and said --&quot; Clam or Cod ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s that about Cods , ma ' am ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I , with much politeness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Clam or Cod ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="she repeated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; A clam for supper ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a cold clam ; is THAT what you mean , Mrs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hussey ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="says I , &quot; but that ' s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time , ain ' t it , Mrs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hussey ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt , who was waiting for it in the entry , and seeming to hear nothing but the word &quot; clam ,&quot; Mrs . Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen , and bawling out &quot; clam for two ,&quot; disappeared ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg ,&quot; said I , &quot; do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when that smoking chowder came in , the mystery was delightfully explained ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , sweet friends !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="hearken to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was made of small juicy clams , scarcely bigger than hazel nuts , mixed with pounded ship biscuit , and salted pork cut up into little flakes ; the whole enriched with butter , and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage , and in particular , Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him , and the chowder being surpassingly excellent , we despatched it with great expedition : when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs . Hussey ' s clam and cod announcement , I thought I would try a little experiment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stepping to the kitchen door , I uttered the word &quot; cod &quot; with great emphasis , and resumed my seat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again , but with a different flavor , and in good time a fine cod - chowder was placed before us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We resumed business ; and while plying our spoons in the bowl , thinks I to myself , I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s that stultifying saying about chowder - headed people ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But look , Queequeg , ain ' t that a live eel in your bowl ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where ' s your harpoon ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots , which well deserved its name ; for the pots there were always boiling chowders ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Chowder for breakfast , and chowder for dinner , and chowder for supper , till you began to look for fish - bones coming through your clothes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The area before the house was paved with clam - shells ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mrs . Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra ; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark - skin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was a fishy flavor to the milk , too , which I could not at all account for , till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen ' s boats , I saw Hosea ' s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants , and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod ' s decapitated head , looking very slip - shod , I assure ye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Supper concluded , we received a lamp , and directions from Mrs . Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; but , as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs , the lady reached forth her arm , and demanded his harpoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why not ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I ; &quot; every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon -- but why not ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Because it ' s dangerous ,&quot; says she ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort ' nt v ' y ' ge of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of ILE , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , Mr . Queequeg &quot; ( for she had learned his name ), &quot; I will just take this here iron , and keep it for you till morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the chowder ; clam or cod to - morrow for breakfast , men ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Both ,&quot; says I ; &quot; and let ' s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 16" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to my surprise and no small concern , Queequeg now gave me to understand , that he had been diligently consulting Yojo -- the name of his black little god -- and Yojo had told him two or three times over , and strongly insisted upon it everyway , that instead of our going together among the whaling - fleet in harbor , and in concert selecting our craft ; instead of this , I say , Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me , inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us ; and , in order to do so , had already pitched upon a vessel , which , if left to myself , I , Ishmael , should infallibly light upon , for all the world as though it had turned out by chance ; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself , for the present irrespective of Queequeg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have forgotten to mention that , in many things , Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo ' s judgment and surprising forecast of things ; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem , as a rather good sort of god , who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole , but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , this plan of Queequeg ' s , or rather Yojo ' s , touching the selection of our craft ; I did not like that plan at all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I had not a little relied upon Queequeg ' s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg , I was obliged to acquiesce ; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor , that should quickly settle that trifling little affair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next morning early , leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom -- for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan , or day of fasting , humiliation , and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day ; HOW it was I never could find out , for , though I applied myself to it several times , I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles -- leaving Queequeg , then , fasting on his tomahawk pipe , and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings , I sallied out among the shipping ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries , I learnt that there were three ships up for three - years ' voyages -- The Devil - dam , the Tit - bit , and the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="DEVIL - DAM , I do not know the origin of ; TIT - BIT is obvious ; PEQUOD , you will no doubt remember , was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians ; now extinct as the ancient Medes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I peered and pryed about the Devil - dam ; from her , hopped over to the Tit - bit ; and finally , going on board the Pequod , looked around her for a moment , and then decided that this was the very ship for us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day , for aught I know ;-- square - toed luggers ; mountainous Japanese junks ; butter - box galliots , and what not ; but take my word for it , you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old - fashioned claw - footed look about her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Long seasoned and weather - stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans , her old hull ' s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier ' s , who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Her venerable bows looked bearded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Her masts -- cut somewhere on the coast of Japan , where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale -- her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled , like the pilgrim - worshipped flag - stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to all these her old antiquities , were added new and marvellous features , pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Old Captain Peleg , many years her chief - mate , before he commanded another vessel of his own , and now a retired seaman , and one of the principal owners of the Pequod ,-- this old Peleg , during the term of his chief - mateship , had built upon her original grotesqueness , and inlaid it , all over , with a quaintness both of material and device , unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill - Hake ' s carved buckler or bedstead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor , his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She was a thing of trophies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All round , her unpanelled , open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw , with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale , inserted there for pins , to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood , but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea - ivory ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm , she sported there a tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass , curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest , felt like the Tartar , when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A noble craft , but somehow a most melancholy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All noble things are touched with that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now when I looked about the quarter - deck , for some one having authority , in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage , at first I saw nobody ; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent , or rather wigwam , pitched a little behind the main - mast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seemed only a temporary erection used in port ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was of a conical shape , some ten feet high ; consisting of the long , huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right - whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Planted with their broad ends on the deck , a circle of these slabs laced together , mutually sloped towards each other , and at the apex united in a tufted point , where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top - knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem ' s head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship , so that the insider commanded a complete view forward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And half concealed in this queer tenement , I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship ' s work suspended , was now enjoying respite from the burden of command ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was seated on an old - fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was nothing so very particular , perhaps , about the appearance of the elderly man I saw ; he was brown and brawny , like most old seamen , and heavily rolled up in blue pilot - cloth , cut in the Quaker style ; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net - work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes , which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales , and always looking to windward ;-- for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such eye - wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Is this the Captain of the Pequod ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I , advancing to the door of the tent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod , what dost thou want of him ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he demanded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I was thinking of shipping .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou wast , wast thou ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I see thou art no Nantucketer -- ever been in a stove boat ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , Sir , I never have .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Dost know nothing at all about whaling , I dare say -- eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Nothing , Sir ; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ve been several voyages in the merchant service , and I think that --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Merchant service be damned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Talk not that lingo to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dost see that leg ?-- I ' ll take that leg away from thy stern , if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Marchant service indeed !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But flukes !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="man , what makes thee want to go a whaling , eh ?-- it looks a little suspicious , don ' t it , eh ?-- Hast not been a pirate , hast thou ?-- Didst not rob thy last Captain , didst thou ?-- Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I protested my innocence of these things ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes , this old seaman , as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer , was full of his insular prejudices , and rather distrustful of all aliens , unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But what takes thee a - whaling ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I want to know that before I think of shipping ye .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , sir , I want to see what whaling is ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I want to see the world .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Want to see what whaling is , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Who is Captain Ahab , sir ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye , I thought so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I am mistaken then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg -- that ' s who ye are speaking to , young man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage , and supplied with all her needs , including crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We are part owners and agents ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as I was going to say , if thou wantest to know what whaling is , as thou tellest ye do , I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it , past backing out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Clap eye on Captain Ahab , young man , and thou wilt find that he has only one leg .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What do you mean , sir ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Was the other one lost by a whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lost by a whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Young man , come nearer to me : it was devoured , chewed up , crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat !-- ah , ah !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was a little alarmed by his energy , perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation , but said as calmly as I could , &quot; What you say is no doubt true enough , sir ; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale , though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look ye now , young man , thy lungs are a sort of soft , d ' ye see ; thou dost not talk shark a bit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="SURE , ye ' ve been to sea before now ; sure of that ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sir ,&quot; said I , &quot; I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hard down out of that !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mind what I said about the marchant service -- don ' t aggravate me -- I won ' t have it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But let us understand each other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have given thee a hint about what whaling is ; do ye yet feel inclined for it ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I do , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Very good ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale ' s throat , and then jump after it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Answer , quick !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I am , sir , if it should be positively indispensable to do so ; not to be got rid of , that is ; which I don ' t take to be the fact .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Good again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now then , thou not only wantest to go a - whaling , to find out by experience what whaling is , but ye also want to go in order to see the world ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Was not that what ye said ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I thought so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well then , just step forward there , and take a peep over the weather - bow , and then back to me and tell me what ye see there .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request , not knowing exactly how to take it , whether humorously or in earnest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But concentrating all his crow ' s feet into one scowl , Captain Peleg started me on the errand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Going forward and glancing over the weather bow , I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood - tide , was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The prospect was unlimited , but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding ; not the slightest variety that I could see ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , what ' s the report ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Peleg when I came back ; &quot; what did ye see ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Not much ,&quot; I replied --&quot; nothing but water ; considerable horizon though , and there ' s a squall coming up , I think .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , what does thou think then of seeing the world ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can ' t ye see the world where you stand ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was a little staggered , but go a - whaling I must , and I would ; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any -- I thought the best -- and all this I now repeated to Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing me so determined , he expressed his willingness to ship me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off ,&quot; he added --&quot; come along with ye .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so saying , he led the way below deck into the cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It turned out to be Captain Bildad , who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel ; the other shares , as is sometimes the case in these ports , being held by a crowd of old annuitants ; widows , fatherless children , and chancery wards ; each owning about the value of a timber head , or a foot of plank , or a nail or two in the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels , the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , Bildad , like Peleg , and indeed many other Nantucketers , was a Quaker , the island having been originally settled by that sect ; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker , only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale - hunters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They are fighting Quakers ; they are Quakers with a vengeance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that there are instances among them of men , who , named with Scripture names -- a singularly common fashion on the island -- and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom ; still , from the audacious , daring , and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives , strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities , a thousand bold dashes of character , not unworthy a Scandinavian sea - king , or a poetical Pagan Roman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force , with a globular brain and a ponderous heart ; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night - watches in the remotest waters , and beneath constellations never seen here at the north , been led to think untraditionally and independently ; receiving all nature ' s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast , and thereby chiefly , but with some help from accidental advantages , to learn a bold and nervous lofty language -- that man makes one in a whole nation ' s census -- a mighty pageant creature , formed for noble tragedies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor will it at all detract from him , dramatically regarded , if either by birth or other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be sure of this , O young ambition , all mortal greatness is but disease ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , as yet we have not to do with such an one , but with quite another ; and still a man , who , if indeed peculiar , it only results again from another phase of the Quaker , modified by individual circumstances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like Captain Peleg , Captain Bildad was a well - to - do , retired whaleman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But unlike Captain Peleg -- who cared not a rush for what are called serious things , and indeed deemed those self - same serious things the veriest of all trifles -- Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism , but all his subsequent ocean life , and the sight of many unclad , lovely island creatures , round the Horn -- all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot , had not so much as altered one angle of his vest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still , for all this immutableness , was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though refusing , from conscientious scruples , to bear arms against land invaders , yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific ; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed , yet had he in his straight - bodied coat , spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How now in the contemplative evening of his days , the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence , I do not know ; but it did not seem to concern him much , and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man ' s religion is one thing , and this practical world quite another ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This world pays dividends ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Rising from a little cabin - boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab , to a harpooneer in a broad shad - bellied waistcoat ; from that becoming boat - header , chief - mate , and captain , and finally a ship owner ; Bildad , as I hinted before , had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty , and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well - earned income ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , Bildad , I am sorry to say , had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks , and in his sea - going days , a bitter , hard task - master ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They told me in Nantucket , though it certainly seems a curious story , that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman , his crew , upon arriving home , were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital , sore exhausted and worn out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a pious man , especially for a Quaker , he was certainly rather hard - hearted , to say the least ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He never used to swear , though , at his men , they said ; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel , unmitigated hard work out of them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When Bildad was a chief - mate , to have his drab - coloured eye intently looking at you , made you feel completely nervous , till you could clutch something -- a hammer or a marling - spike , and go to work like mad , at something or other , never mind what ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Indolence and idleness perished before him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On his long , gaunt body , he carried no spare flesh , no superfluous beard , his chin having a soft , economical nap to it , like the worn nap of his broad - brimmed hat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such , then , was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The space between the decks was small ; and there , bolt - upright , sat old Bildad , who always sat so , and never leaned , and this to save his coat tails ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His broad - brim was placed beside him ; his legs were stiffly crossed ; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin ; and spectacles on nose , he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Bildad ,&quot; cried Captain Peleg , &quot; at it again , Bildad , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ye have been studying those Scriptures , now , for the last thirty years , to my certain knowledge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How far ye got , Bildad ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate , Bildad , without noticing his present irreverence , quietly looked up , and seeing me , glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He says he ' s our man , Bildad ,&quot; said Peleg , &quot; he wants to ship .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Dost thee ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Bildad , in a hollow tone , and turning round to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I dost ,&quot; said I unconsciously , he was so intense a Quaker ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What do ye think of him , Bildad ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' ll do ,&quot; said Bildad , eyeing me , and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw , especially as Peleg , his friend and old shipmate , seemed such a blusterer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I said nothing , only looking round me sharply ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Peleg now threw open a chest , and drawing forth the ship ' s articles , placed pen and ink before him , and seated himself at a little table ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages ; but all hands , including the captain , received certain shares of the profits called lays , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship ' s company ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling , my own lay would not be very large ; but considering that I was used to the sea , could steer a ship , splice a rope , and all that , I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay -- that is , the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage , whatever that might eventually amount to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather LONG LAY , yet it was better than nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage , might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it , not to speak of my three years ' beef and board , for which I would not have to pay one stiver ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune -- and so it was , a very poor way indeed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes , and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me , while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon the whole , I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing , but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th , considering I was of a broad - shouldered make ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But one thing , nevertheless , that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this : Ashore , I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad ; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod , therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners , left nearly the whole management of the ship ' s affairs to these two ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands , especially as I now found him on board the Pequod , quite at home there in the cabin , and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack - knife , old Bildad , to my no small surprise , considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings ; Bildad never heeded us , but went on mumbling to himself out of his book , &quot; LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , Captain Bildad ,&quot; interrupted Peleg , &quot; what d ' ye say , what lay shall we give this young man ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou knowest best ,&quot; was the sepulchral reply , &quot; the seven hundred and seventy - seventh wouldn ' t be too much , would it ?--' where moth and rust do corrupt , but LAY --'&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="LAY , indeed , thought I , and such a lay !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the seven hundred and seventy - seventh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , old Bildad , you are determined that I , for one , shall not LAY up many LAYS here below , where moth and rust do corrupt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that , indeed ; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman , yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy - seven is a pretty large number , yet , when you come to make a TEENTH of it , you will then see , I say , that the seven hundred and seventy - seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy - seven gold doubloons ; and so I thought at the time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why , blast your eyes , Bildad ,&quot; cried Peleg , &quot; thou dost not want to swindle this young man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he must have more than that .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Seven hundred and seventy - seventh ,&quot; again said Bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling --&quot; for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I am going to put him down for the three hundredth ,&quot; said Peleg , &quot; do ye hear that , Bildad !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The three hundredth lay , I say .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bildad laid down his book , and turning solemnly towards him said , &quot; Captain Peleg , thou hast a generous heart ; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship -- widows and orphans , many of them -- and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man , we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The seven hundred and seventy - seventh lay , Captain Peleg .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou Bildad !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="roared Peleg , starting up and clattering about the cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Blast ye , Captain Bildad , if I had followed thy advice in these matters , I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Peleg ,&quot; said Bildad steadily , &quot; thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , I can ' t tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man , Captain Peleg , I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit , Captain Peleg .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Fiery pit !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="fiery pit !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ye insult me , man ; past all natural bearing , ye insult me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s an all - fired outrage to tell any human creature that he ' s bound to hell ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Flukes and flames !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bildad , say that again to me , and start my soul - bolts , but I ' ll -- I ' ll -- yes , I ' ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Out of the cabin , ye canting , drab - coloured son of a wooden gun -- a straight wake with ye !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad , but with a marvellous oblique , sliding celerity , Bildad for that time eluded him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship , and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded , I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad , who , I made no doubt , was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to my astonishment , he sat down again on the transom very quietly , and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for Peleg , after letting off his rage as he had , there seemed no more left in him , and he , too , sat down like a lamb , though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Whew !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he whistled at last --&quot; the squall ' s gone off to leeward , I think ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bildad , thou used to be good at sharpening a lance , mend that pen , will ye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My jack - knife here needs the grindstone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ' s he ; thank ye , Bildad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now then , my young man , Ishmael ' s thy name , didn ' t ye say ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well then , down ye go here , Ishmael , for the three hundredth lay .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Peleg ,&quot; said I , &quot; I have a friend with me who wants to ship too -- shall I bring him down to - morrow ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; To be sure ,&quot; said Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Fetch him along , and we ' ll look at him .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What lay does he want ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="groaned Bildad , glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="never thee mind about that , Bildad ,&quot; said Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Has he ever whaled it any ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="turning to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Killed more whales than I can count , Captain Peleg .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , bring him along then .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , after signing the papers , off I went ; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning ' s work , and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I had not proceeded far , when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me ; though , indeed , in many cases , a whale - ship will be completely fitted out , and receive all her crew on board , ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command ; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged , and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief , that if the captain have a family , or any absorbing concernment of that sort , he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port , but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg , inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s all right enough ; thou art shipped .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes , but I should like to see him .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But I don ' t think thou wilt be able to at present ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I don ' t know exactly what ' s the matter with him ; but he keeps close inside the house ; a sort of sick , and yet he don ' t look so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , he ain ' t sick ; but no , he isn ' t well either ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Any how , young man , he won ' t always see me , so I don ' t suppose he will thee ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ' s a queer man , Captain Ahab -- so some think -- but a good one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , thou ' lt like him well enough ; no fear , no fear ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ' s a grand , ungodly , god - like man , Captain Ahab ; doesn ' t speak much ; but , when he does speak , then you may well listen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mark ye , be forewarned ; Ahab ' s above the common ; Ahab ' s been in colleges , as well as ' mong the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His lance !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="aye , the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he ain ' t Captain Bildad ; no , and he ain ' t Captain Peleg ; HE ' S AHAB , boy ; and Ahab of old , thou knowest , was a crowned king !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And a very vile one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When that wicked king was slain , the dogs , did they not lick his blood ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Come hither to me -- hither , hither ,&quot; said Peleg , with a significance in his eye that almost startled me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look ye , lad ; never say that on board the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Never say it anywhere ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Ahab did not name himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Twas a foolish , ignorant whim of his crazy , widowed mother , who died when he was only a twelvemonth old ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yet the old squaw Tistig , at Gayhead , said that the name would somehow prove prophetic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , perhaps , other fools like her may tell thee the same ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I wish to warn thee ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s a lie ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know Captain Ahab well ; I ' ve sailed with him as mate years ago ; I know what he is -- a good man -- not a pious , good man , like Bildad , but a swearing good man -- something like me -- only there ' s a good deal more of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , aye , I know that he was never very jolly ; and I know that on the passage home , he was a little out of his mind for a spell ; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about , as any one might see ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know , too , that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale , he ' s been a kind of moody -- desperate moody , and savage sometimes ; but that will all pass off ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And once for all , let me tell thee and assure thee , young man , it ' s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So good - bye to thee -- and wrong not Captain Ahab , because he happens to have a wicked name ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , my boy , he has a wife -- not three voyages wedded -- a sweet , resigned girl ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Think of that ; by that sweet girl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be any utter , hopeless harm in Ahab ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , no , my lad ; stricken , blasted , if he be , Ahab has his humanities !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As I walked away , I was full of thoughtfulness ; what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab , filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And somehow , at the time , I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him , but for I don ' t know what , unless it was the cruel loss of his leg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yet I also felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe , which I cannot at all describe , was not exactly awe ; I do not know what it was ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I felt it ; and it did not disincline me towards him ; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him , so imperfectly as he was known to me then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , my thoughts were at length carried in other directions , so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 17" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Ramadan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As Queequeg ' s Ramadan , or Fasting and Humiliation , was to continue all day , I did not choose to disturb him till towards night - fall ; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody ' s religious obligations , never mind how comical , and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad - stool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth , who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets , bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say , we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things , and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals , pagans and what not , because of their half - crazy conceits on these subjects ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was Queequeg , now , certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan ;-- but what of that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg thought he knew what he was about , I suppose ; he seemed to be content ; and there let him rest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All our arguing with him would not avail ; let him be , I say : and Heaven have mercy on us all -- Presbyterians and Pagans alike -- for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head , and sadly need mending ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Towards evening , when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over , I went up to his room and knocked at the door ; but no answer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I tried to open it , but it was fastened inside ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg ,&quot; said I softly through the key - hole :-- all silent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I say , Queequeg !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="why don ' t you speak ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s I -- Ishmael .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all remained still as before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I began to grow alarmed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I had allowed him such abundant time ; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I looked through the key - hole ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room , the key - hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I could only see part of the foot - board of the bed and a line of the wall , but nothing more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg ' s harpoon , which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him , before our mounting to the chamber ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ' s strange , thought I ; but at any rate , since the harpoon stands yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it , therefore he must be inside here , and no possible mistake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg !-- Queequeg !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- all still ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Something must have happened ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Apoplexy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I tried to burst open the door ; but it stubbornly resisted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Running down stairs , I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met -- the chamber - maid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; La !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="la !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="she cried , &quot; I thought something must be the matter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I went to make the bed after breakfast , and the door was locked ; and not a mouse to be heard ; and it ' s been just so silent ever since ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I thought , may be , you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="La !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="la , ma ' am !-- Mistress !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="murder !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mrs . Hussey !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="apoplexy !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- and with these cries , she ran towards the kitchen , I following ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mrs . Hussey soon appeared , with a mustard - pot in one hand and a vinegar - cruet in the other , having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors , and scolding her little black boy meantime ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Wood - house !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried I , &quot; which way to it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Run for God ' s sake , and fetch something to pry open the door -- the axe !-- the axe !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he ' s had a stroke ; depend upon it !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty - handed , when Mrs . Hussey interposed the mustard - pot and vinegar - cruet , and the entire castor of her countenance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s the matter with you , young man ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Get the axe !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For God ' s sake , run for the doctor , some one , while I pry it open !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look here ,&quot; said the landlady , quickly putting down the vinegar - cruet , so as to have one hand free ; &quot; look here ; are you talking about prying open any of my doors ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- and with that she seized my arm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s the matter with you ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s the matter with you , shipmate ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In as calm , but rapid a manner as possible , I gave her to understand the whole case ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unconsciously clapping the vinegar - cruet to one side of her nose , she ruminated for an instant ; then exclaimed --&quot; No !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I haven ' t seen it since I put it there .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs , she glanced in , and returning , told me that Queequeg ' s harpoon was missing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' s killed himself ,&quot; she cried ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It ' s unfort ' nate Stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane -- God pity his poor mother !-- it will be the ruin of my house ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Has the poor lad a sister ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where ' s that girl ?-- there , Betty , go to Snarles the Painter , and tell him to paint me a sign , with --&quot; no suicides permitted here , and no smoking in the parlor ;&quot;-- might as well kill both birds at once ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Kill ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Lord be merciful to his ghost !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s that noise there ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You , young man , avast there !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And running up after me , she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I don ' t allow it ; I won ' t have my premises spoiled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Go for the locksmith , there ' s one about a mile from here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But avast !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="putting her hand in her side - pocket , &quot; here ' s a key that ' ll fit , I guess ; let ' s see .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And with that , she turned it in the lock ; but , alas !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg ' s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Have to burst it open ,&quot; said I , and was running down the entry a little , for a good start , when the landlady caught at me , again vowing I should not break down her premises ; but I tore from her , and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a prodigious noise the door flew open , and the knob slamming against the wall , sent the plaster to the ceiling ; and there , good heavens !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there sat Queequeg , altogether cool and self - collected ; right in the middle of the room ; squatting on his hams , and holding Yojo on top of his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He looked neither one way nor the other way , but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg ,&quot; said I , going up to him , &quot; Queequeg , what ' s the matter with you ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He hain ' t been a sittin ' so all day , has he ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said the landlady ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all we said , not a word could we drag out of him ; I almost felt like pushing him over , so as to change his position , for it was almost intolerable , it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained ; especially , as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours , going too without his regular meals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mrs . Hussey ,&quot; said I , &quot; he ' s ALIVE at all events ; so leave us , if you please , and I will see to this strange affair myself .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Closing the door upon the landlady , I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There he sat ; and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in the slightest way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I wonder , thought I , if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It must be so ; yes , it ' s part of his creed , I suppose ; well , then , let him rest ; he ' ll get up sooner or later , no doubt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It can ' t last for ever , thank God , and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I don ' t believe it ' s very punctual then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I went down to supper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum - pudding voyage , as they called it ( that is , a short whaling - voyage in a schooner or brig , confined to the north of the line , in the Atlantic Ocean only ); after listening to these plum - puddingers till nearly eleven o ' clock , I went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no ; there he was just where I had left him ; he had not stirred an inch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I began to grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room , holding a piece of wood on his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; For heaven ' s sake , Queequeg , get up and shake yourself ; get up and have some supper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You ' ll starve ; you ' ll kill yourself , Queequeg .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not a word did he reply ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Despairing of him , therefore , I determined to go to bed and to sleep ; and no doubt , before a great while , he would follow me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But previous to turning in , I took my heavy bearskin jacket , and threw it over him , as it promised to be a very cold night ; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For some time , do all I would , I could not get into the faintest doze ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I had blown out the candle ; and the mere thought of Queequeg -- not four feet off -- sitting there in that uneasy position , stark alone in the cold and dark ; this made me really wretched ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Think of it ; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary , unaccountable Ramadan !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But somehow I dropped off at last , and knew nothing more till break of day ; when , looking over the bedside , there squatted Queequeg , as if he had been screwed down to the floor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window , up he got , with stiff and grating joints , but with a cheerful look ; limped towards me where I lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said his Ramadan was over ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , as I before hinted , I have no objection to any person ' s religion , be it what it may , so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person , because that other person don ' t believe it also ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when a man ' s religion becomes really frantic ; when it is a positive torment to him ; and , in fine , makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in ; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And just so I now did with Queequeg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg ,&quot; said I , &quot; get into bed now , and lie and listen to me .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I then went on , beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions , and coming down to the various religions of the present time , during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents , Ramadans , and prolonged ham - squattings in cold , cheerless rooms were stark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; opposed , in short , to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I told him , too , that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage , it pained me , very badly pained me , to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , argued I , fasting makes the body cave in ; hence the spirit caves in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half - starved ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In one word , Queequeg , said I , rather digressively ; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple - dumpling ; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia ; expressing the idea very plainly , so that he could take it in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He said no ; only upon one memorable occasion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was after a great feast given by his father the king , on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o ' clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and eaten that very evening ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No more , Queequeg ,&quot; said I , shuddering ; &quot; that will do ;&quot; for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island , and he told me that it was the custom , when a great battle had been gained there , to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor ; and then , one by one , they were placed in great wooden trenchers , and garnished round like a pilau , with breadfruit and cocoanuts ; and with some parsley in their mouths , were sent round with the victor ' s compliments to all his friends , just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After all , I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because , in the first place , he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject , unless considered from his own point of view ; and , in the second place , he did not more than one third understand me , couch my ideas simply as I would ; and , finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion , as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last we rose and dressed ; and Queequeg , taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts , so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan , we sallied out to board the Pequod , sauntering along , and picking our teeth with halibut bones ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 18" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His Mark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship , Queequeg carrying his harpoon , Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam , saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal , and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft , unless they previously produced their papers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What do you mean by that , Captain Peleg ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I , now jumping on the bulwarks , and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I mean ,&quot; he replied , &quot; he must show his papers .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes ,&quot; said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice , sticking his head from behind Peleg ' s , out of the wigwam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He must show that he ' s converted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Son of darkness ,&quot; he added , turning to Queequeg , &quot; art thou at present in communion with any Christian church ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why ,&quot; said I , &quot; he ' s a member of the first Congregational Church .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here be it said , that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; First Congregational Church ,&quot; cried Bildad , &quot; what !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman ' s meeting - house ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and so saying , taking out his spectacles , he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief , and putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam , and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks , took a good long look at Queequeg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; How long hath he been a member ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he then said , turning to me ; &quot; not very long , I rather guess , young man .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No ,&quot; said Peleg , &quot; and he hasn ' t been baptized right either , or it would have washed some of that devil ' s blue off his face .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Do tell , now ,&quot; cried Bildad , &quot; is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy ' s meeting ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I never saw him going there , and I pass it every Lord ' s day .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I don ' t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting ,&quot; said I ; &quot; all I know is , that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is a deacon himself , Queequeg is .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Young man ,&quot; said Bildad sternly , &quot; thou art skylarking with me -- explain thyself , thou young Hittite ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What church dost thee mean ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="answer me .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Finding myself thus hard pushed , I replied ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I mean , sir , the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I , and Captain Peleg there , and Queequeg here , and all of us , and every mother ' s son and soul of us belong ; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief ; in THAT we all join hands .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Splice , thou mean ' st SPLICE hands ,&quot; cried Peleg , drawing nearer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Young man , you ' d better ship for a missionary , instead of a fore - mast hand ; I never heard a better sermon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Deacon Deuteronomy -- why Father Mapple himself couldn ' t beat it , and he ' s reckoned something ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come aboard , come aboard ; never mind about the papers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say , tell Quohog there -- what ' s that you call him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="tell Quohog to step along ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the great anchor , what a harpoon he ' s got there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="looks like good stuff that ; and he handles it about right ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say , Quohog , or whatever your name is , did you ever stand in the head of a whale - boat ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="did you ever strike a fish ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Without saying a word , Queequeg , in his wild sort of way , jumped upon the bulwarks , from thence into the bows of one of the whale - boats hanging to the side ; and then bracing his left knee , and poising his harpoon , cried out in some such way as this :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Cap ' ain , you see him small drop tar on water dere ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You see him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="well , spose him one whale eye , well , den !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and taking sharp aim at it , he darted the iron right over old Bildad ' s broad brim , clean across the ship ' s decks , and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Now ,&quot; said Queequeg , quietly hauling in the line , &quot; spos - ee him whale - e eye ; why , dad whale dead .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Quick , Bildad ,&quot; said Peleg , his partner , who , aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon , had retreated towards the cabin gangway ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Quick , I say , you Bildad , and get the ship ' s papers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We must have Hedgehog there , I mean Quohog , in one of our boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look ye , Quohog , we ' ll give ye the ninetieth lay , and that ' s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So down we went into the cabin , and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship ' s company to which I myself belonged ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing , he turned to me and said , &quot; I guess , Quohog there don ' t know how to write , does he ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say , Quohog , blast ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at this question , Queequeg , who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies , looked no ways abashed ; but taking the offered pen , copied upon the paper , in the proper place , an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm ; so that through Captain Peleg ' s obstinate mistake touching his appellative , it stood something like this :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Quohog ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="his X mark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg , and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad - skirted drab coat , took out a bundle of tracts , and selecting one entitled &quot; The Latter Day Coming ; or No Time to Lose ,&quot; placed it in Queequeg ' s hands , and then grasping them and the book with both his , looked earnestly into his eyes , and said , &quot; Son of darkness , I must do my duty by thee ; I am part owner of this ship , and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew ; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways , which I sadly fear , I beseech thee , remain not for aye a Belial bondsman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Spurn the idol Bell , and the hideous dragon ; turn from the wrath to come ; mind thine eye , I say ; oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="goodness gracious !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="steer clear of the fiery pit !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad ' s language , heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Avast there , avast there , Bildad , avast now spoiling our harpooneer ,&quot; Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers -- it takes the shark out of ' em ; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was young Nat Swaine , once the bravest boat - header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard ; he joined the meeting , and never came to good ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He got so frightened about his plaguy soul , that he shrinked and sheered away from whales , for fear of after - claps , in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Peleg !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Peleg !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Bildad , lifting his eyes and hands , &quot; thou thyself , as I myself , hast seen many a perilous time ; thou knowest , Peleg , what it is to have the fear of death ; how , then , can ' st thou prate in this ungodly guise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou beliest thine own heart , Peleg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tell me , when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan , that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab , did ' st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hear him , hear him now ,&quot; cried Peleg , marching across the cabin , and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets ,--&quot; hear him , all of ye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Think of that !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When every moment we thought the ship would sink !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Death and the Judgment then ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side ; and every sea breaking over us , fore and aft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Think of Death and the Judgment then ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="no time to think about Death then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of ; and how to save all hands -- how to rig jury - masts -- how to get into the nearest port ; that was what I was thinking of .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bildad said no more , but buttoning up his coat , stalked on deck , where we followed him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There he stood , very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top - sail in the waist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch , or save an end of tarred twine , which otherwise might have been wasted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 19" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Prophet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Shipmates , have ye shipped in that ship ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod , and were sauntering away from the water , for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts , when the above words were put to us by a stranger , who , pausing before us , levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers ; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A confluent small - pox had in all directions flowed over his face , and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent , when the rushing waters have been dried up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Have ye shipped in her ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he repeated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; You mean the ship Pequod , I suppose ,&quot; said I , trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , the Pequod -- that ship there ,&quot; he said , drawing back his whole arm , and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him , with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes ,&quot; said I , &quot; we have just signed the articles .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Anything down there about your souls ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; About what ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , perhaps you hav ' n ' t got any ,&quot; he said quickly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No matter though , I know many chaps that hav ' n ' t got any ,-- good luck to ' em ; and they are all the better off for it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A soul ' s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What are you jabbering about , shipmate ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; HE ' S got enough , though , to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps ,&quot; abruptly said the stranger , placing a nervous emphasis upon the word HE ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg ,&quot; said I , &quot; let ' s go ; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere ; he ' s talking about something and somebody we don ' t know .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stop !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the stranger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ye said true -- ye hav ' n ' t seen Old Thunder yet , have ye ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Who ' s Old Thunder ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I , again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Ahab .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the captain of our ship , the Pequod ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , among some of us old sailor chaps , he goes by that name ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ye hav ' n ' t seen him yet , have ye ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , we hav ' n ' t ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ' s sick they say , but is getting better , and will be all right again before long .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; All right again before long !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="laughed the stranger , with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look ye ; when Captain Ahab is all right , then this left arm of mine will be all right ; not before .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What do you know about him ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What did they TELL you about him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Say that !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; They didn ' t tell much of anything about him ; only I ' ve heard that he ' s a good whale - hunter , and a good captain to his crew .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; That ' s true , that ' s true -- yes , both true enough ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But you must jump when he gives an order ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Step and growl ; growl and go -- that ' s the word with Captain Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn , long ago , when he lay like dead for three days and nights ; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa ?-- heard nothing about that , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage , according to the prophecy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Didn ' t ye hear a word about them matters and something more , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , I don ' t think ye did ; how could ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who knows it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not all Nantucket , I guess ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But hows ' ever , mayhap , ye ' ve heard tell about the leg , and how he lost it ; aye , ye have heard of that , I dare say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh yes , THAT every one knows a ' most -- I mean they know he ' s only one leg ; and that a parmacetti took the other off .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; My friend ,&quot; said I , &quot; what all this gibberish of yours is about , I don ' t know , and I don ' t much care ; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab , of that ship there , the Pequod , then let me tell you , that I know all about the loss of his leg .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; ALL about it , eh -- sure you do ?-- all ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pretty sure .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod , the beggar - like stranger stood a moment , as if in a troubled reverie ; then starting a little , turned and said :--&quot; Ye ' ve shipped , have ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Names down on the papers ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , well , what ' s signed , is signed ; and what ' s to be , will be ; and then again , perhaps it won ' t be , after all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Anyhow , it ' s all fixed and arranged a ' ready ; and some sailors or other must go with him , I suppose ; as well these as any other men , God pity ' em !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Morning to ye , shipmates , morning ; the ineffable heavens bless ye ; I ' m sorry I stopped ye .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look here , friend ,&quot; said I , &quot; if you have anything important to tell us , out with it ; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us , you are mistaken in your game ; that ' s all I have to say .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And it ' s said very well , and I like to hear a chap talk up that way ; you are just the man for him -- the likes of ye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Morning to ye , shipmates , morning !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="when ye get there , tell ' em I ' ve concluded not to make one of ' em .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ah , my dear fellow , you can ' t fool us that way -- you can ' t fool us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Morning to ye , shipmates , morning .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Morning it is ,&quot; said I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Come along , Queequeg , let ' s leave this crazy man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But stop , tell me your name , will you ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Elijah .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Elijah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thought I , and we walked away , both commenting , after each other ' s fashion , upon this ragged old sailor ; and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug , trying to be a bugbear ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards , when chancing to turn a corner , and looking back as I did so , who should be seen but Elijah following us , though at a distance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Somehow , the sight of him struck me so , that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind , but passed on with my comrade , anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He did ; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us , but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This circumstance , coupled with his ambiguous , half - hinting , half - revealing , shrouded sort of talk , now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half - apprehensions , and all connected with the Pequod ; and Captain Ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; and the Cape Horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what Captain Peleg had said of him , when I left the ship the day previous ; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig ; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a hundred other shadowy things ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not , and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg , and on that side of it retraced our steps ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Elijah passed on , without seeming to notice us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This relieved me ; and once more , and finally as it seemed to me , I pronounced him in my heart , a humbug ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 20" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All Astir ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not only were the old sails being mended , but new sails were coming on board , and bolts of canvas , and coils of rigging ; in short , everything betokened that the ship ' s preparations were hurrying to a close ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore , but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look - out upon the hands : Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night - fall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the day following Queequeg ' s signing the articles , word was given at all the inns where the ship ' s company were stopping , that their chests must be on board before night , for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So Queequeg and I got down our traps , resolving , however , to sleep ashore till the last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases , and the ship did not sail for several days ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no wonder ; there was a good deal to be done , and there is no telling how many things to be thought of , before the Pequod was fully equipped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Every one knows what a multitude of things -- beds , sauce - pans , knives and forks , shovels and tongs , napkins , nut - crackers , and what not , are indispensable to the business of housekeeping ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Just so with whaling , which necessitates a three - years ' housekeeping upon the wide ocean , far from all grocers , costermongers , doctors , bakers , and bankers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And though this also holds true of merchant vessels , yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For besides the great length of the whaling voyage , the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery , and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented , it must be remembered , that of all ships , whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds , and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hence , the spare boats , spare spars , and spare lines and harpoons , and spare everythings , almost , but a spare Captain and duplicate ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the period of our arrival at the Island , the heaviest storage of the Pequod had been almost completed ; comprising her beef , bread , water , fuel , and iron hoops and staves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , as before hinted , for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things , both large and small ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad ' s sister , a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit , but withal very kindhearted , who seemed resolved that , if SHE could help it , nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod , after once fairly getting to sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward ' s pantry ; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate ' s desk , where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one ' s rheumatic back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Never did any woman better deserve her name , which was Charity -- Aunt Charity , as everybody called her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither , ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety , comfort , and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned , and in which she herself owned a score or two of well - saved dollars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board , as she did the last day , with a long oil - ladle in one hand , and a still longer whaling lance in the other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for Bildad , he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed , and at every fresh arrival , down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den , roaring at the men down the hatchways , roaring up to the riggers at the mast - head , and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="During these days of preparation , Queequeg and I often visited the craft , and as often I asked about Captain Ahab , and how he was , and when he was going to come on board his ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To these questions they would answer , that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; meantime , the two captains , Peleg and Bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If I had been downright honest with myself , I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage , without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it , so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when a man suspects any wrong , it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter , he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And much this way it was with me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I said nothing , and tried to think nothing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So next morning , Queequeg and I took a very early start ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 21" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Going Aboard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was nearly six o ' clock , but only grey imperfect misty dawn , when we drew nigh the wharf ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There are some sailors running ahead there , if I see right ,&quot; said I to Queequeg , &quot; it can ' t be shadows ; she ' s off by sunrise , I guess ; come on !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Avast !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried a voice , whose owner at the same time coming close behind us , laid a hand upon both our shoulders , and then insinuating himself between us , stood stooping forward a little , in the uncertain twilight , strangely peering from Queequeg to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was Elijah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Going aboard ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hands off , will you ,&quot; said I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lookee here ,&quot; said Queequeg , shaking himself , &quot; go ' way !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ain ' t going aboard , then ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes , we are ,&quot; said I , &quot; but what business is that of yours ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you know , Mr . Elijah , that I consider you a little impertinent ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , no , no ; I wasn ' t aware of that ,&quot; said Elijah , slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg , with the most unaccountable glances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Elijah ,&quot; said I , &quot; you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans , and would prefer not to be detained .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ye be , be ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Coming back afore breakfast ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' s cracked , Queequeg ,&quot; said I , &quot; come on .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Holloa !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried stationary Elijah , hailing us when we had removed a few paces ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Never mind him ,&quot; said I , &quot; Queequeg , come on .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he stole up to us again , and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder , said --&quot; Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Struck by this plain matter - of - fact question , I answered , saying , &quot; Yes , I thought I did see four or five men ; but it was too dim to be sure .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Very dim , very dim ,&quot; said Elijah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Morning to ye .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Once more we quitted him ; but once more he came softly after us ; and touching my shoulder again , said , &quot; See if you can find ' em now , will ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Find who ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Morning to ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="morning to ye !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he rejoined , again moving off ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was going to warn ye against -- but never mind , never mind -- it ' s all one , all in the family too ;-- sharp frost this morning , ain ' t it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Good - bye to ye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shan ' t see ye again very soon , I guess ; unless it ' s before the Grand Jury .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And with these cracked words he finally departed , leaving me , for the moment , in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last , stepping on board the Pequod , we found everything in profound quiet , not a soul moving ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The cabin entrance was locked within ; the hatches were all on , and lumbered with coils of rigging ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Going forward to the forecastle , we found the slide of the scuttle open ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing a light , we went down , and found only an old rigger there , wrapped in a tattered pea - jacket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was thrown at whole length upon two chests , his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The profoundest slumber slept upon him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Those sailors we saw , Queequeg , where can they have gone to ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I , looking dubiously at the sleeper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it seemed that , when on the wharf , Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to ; hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter , were it not for Elijah ' s otherwise inexplicable question ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I beat the thing down ; and again marking the sleeper , jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body ; telling him to establish himself accordingly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He put his hand upon the sleeper ' s rear , as though feeling if it was soft enough ; and then , without more ado , sat quietly down there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Gracious !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg , don ' t sit there ,&quot; said I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="perry dood seat ,&quot; said Queequeg , &quot; my country way ; won ' t hurt him face .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Face !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said I , &quot; call that his face ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="very benevolent countenance then ; but how hard he breathes , he ' s heaving himself ; get off , Queequeg , you are heavy , it ' s grinding the face of the poor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Get off , Queequeg !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look , he ' ll twitch you off soon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I wonder he don ' t wake .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper , and lighted his tomahawk pipe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I sat at the feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper , from one to the other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , upon questioning him in his broken fashion , Queequeg gave me to understand that , in his land , owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts , the king , chiefs , and great people generally , were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans ; and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect , you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows , and lay them round in the piers and alcoves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , it was very convenient on an excursion ; much better than those garden - chairs which are convertible into walking - sticks ; upon occasion , a chief calling his attendant , and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree , perhaps in some damp marshy place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While narrating these things , every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me , he flourished the hatchet - side of it over the sleeper ' s head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s that for , Queequeg ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Perry easy , kill - e ; oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="perry easy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk - pipe , which , it seemed , had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul , when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole , it began to tell upon him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He breathed with a sort of muffledness ; then seemed troubled in the nose ; then revolved over once or twice ; then sat up and rubbed his eyes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Holloa !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he breathed at last , &quot; who be ye smokers ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Shipped men ,&quot; answered I , &quot; when does she sail ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye , ye are going in her , be ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She sails to - day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Captain came aboard last night .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What Captain ?-- Ahab ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Who but him indeed ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab , when we heard a noise on deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Holloa !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starbuck ' s astir ,&quot; said the rigger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' s a lively chief mate , that ; good man , and a pious ; but all alive now , I must turn to .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so saying he went on deck , and we followed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was now clear sunrise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes ; the riggers bestirred themselves ; the mates were actively engaged ; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 22" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Merry Christmas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At length , towards noon , upon the final dismissal of the ship ' s riggers , and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf , and after the ever - thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale - boat , with her last gift -- a night - cap for Stubb , the second mate , her brother - in - law , and a spare Bible for the steward -- after all this , the two Captains , Peleg and Bildad , issued from the cabin , and turning to the chief mate , Peleg said :" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Now , Mr . Starbuck , are you sure everything is right ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Ahab is all ready -- just spoke to him -- nothing more to be got from shore , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , call all hands , then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Muster ' em aft here -- blast ' em !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No need of profane words , however great the hurry , Peleg ,&quot; said Bildad , &quot; but away with thee , friend Starbuck , and do our bidding .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How now !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage , Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter - deck , just as if they were to be joint - commanders at sea , as well as to all appearances in port ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , as for Captain Ahab , no sign of him was yet to be seen ; only , they said he was in the cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But then , the idea was , that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh , and steering her well out to sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Indeed , as that was not at all his proper business , but the pilot ' s ; and as he was not yet completely recovered -- so they said -- therefore , Captain Ahab stayed below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And all this seemed natural enough ; especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor , but remain over the cabin table , having a farewell merry - making with their shore friends , before they quit the ship for good with the pilot ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there was not much chance to think over the matter , for Captain Peleg was now all alive ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding , and not Bildad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aft here , ye sons of bachelors ,&quot; he cried , as the sailors lingered at the main - mast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mr . Starbuck , drive ' em aft .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Strike the tent there !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- was the next order ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As I hinted before , this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port ; and on board the Pequod , for thirty years , the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Man the capstan !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Blood and thunder !-- jump !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- was the next command , and the crew sprang for the handspikes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now in getting under weigh , the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And here Bildad , who , with Peleg , be it known , in addition to his other officers , was one of the licensed pilots of the port -- he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot - fee to all the ships he was concerned in , for he never piloted any other craft -- Bildad , I say , might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor , and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody , to cheer the hands at the windlass , who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley , with hearty good will ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , not three days previous , Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod , particularly in getting under weigh ; and Charity , his sister , had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman ' s berth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , overseeing the other part of the ship , Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up ; involuntarily I paused on my handspike , and told Queequeg to do the same , thinking of the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was comforting myself , however , with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation , spite of his seven hundred and seventy - seventh lay ; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear , and turning round , was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That was my first kick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Is that the way they heave in the marchant service ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he roared ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Spring , thou sheep - head ; spring , and break thy backbone !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why don ' t ye spring , I say , all of ye -- spring !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Quohog !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="spring , thou chap with the red whiskers ; spring there , Scotch - cap ; spring , thou green pants ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Spring , I say , all of ye , and spring your eyes out !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so saying , he moved along the windlass , here and there using his leg very freely , while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thinks I , Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to - day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last the anchor was up , the sails were set , and off we glided ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a short , cold Christmas ; and as the short northern day merged into night , we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean , whose freezing spray cased us in ice , as in polished armor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight ; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant , vast curving icicles depended from the bows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lank Bildad , as pilot , headed the first watch , and ever and anon , as the old craft deep dived into the green seas , and sent the shivering frost all over her , and the winds howled , and the cordage rang , his steady notes were heard ,--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood , Stand dressed in living green ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So to the Jews old Canaan stood , While Jordan rolled between .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were full of hope and fruition ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic , spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket , there was yet , it then seemed to me , many a pleasant haven in store ; and meads and glades so eternally vernal , that the grass shot up by the spring , untrodden , unwilted , remains at midsummer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last we gained such an offing , that the two pilots were needed no longer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The stout sail - boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was curious and not unpleasing , how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture , especially Captain Bildad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy Capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good - bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him ,-- poor old Bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far - off unseen Eastern Continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face , as much as to say , &quot; Nevertheless , friend Peleg , I can stand it ; yes , I can .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for Peleg himself , he took it more like a philosopher ; but for all his philosophy , there was a tear twinkling in his eye , when the lantern came too near ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And he , too , did not a little run from cabin to deck -- now a word below , and now a word with Starbuck , the chief mate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , at last , he turned to his comrade , with a final sort of look about him ,--&quot; Captain Bildad -- come , old shipmate , we must go ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Back the main - yard there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Boat ahoy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stand by to come close alongside , now !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Careful , careful !-- come , Bildad , boy -- say your last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Luck to ye , Starbuck -- luck to ye , Mr . Stubb -- luck to ye , Mr . Flask -- good - bye and good luck to ye all -- and this day three years I ' ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hurrah and away !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; God bless ye , and have ye in His holy keeping , men ,&quot; murmured old Bildad , almost incoherently ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I hope ye ' ll have fine weather now , so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye -- a pleasant sun is all he needs , and ye ' ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be careful in the hunt , ye mates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t stave the boats needlessly , ye harpooneers ; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="within the year ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t forget your prayers , either ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mr . Starbuck , mind that cooper don ' t waste the spare staves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the sail - needles are in the green locker !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t whale it too much a ' Lord ' s days , men ; but don ' t miss a fair chance either , that ' s rejecting Heaven ' s good gifts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Have an eye to the molasses tierce , Mr . Stubb ; it was a little leaky , I thought ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If ye touch at the islands , Mr . Flask , beware of fornication ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Good - bye , good - bye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t keep that cheese too long down in the hold , Mr . Starbuck ; it ' ll spoil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be careful with the butter -- twenty cents the pound it was , and mind ye , if --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Come , come , Captain Bildad ; stop palavering ,-- away !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and with that , Peleg hurried him over the side , and both dropt into the boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ship and boat diverged ; the cold , damp night breeze blew between ; a screaming gull flew overhead ; the two hulls wildly rolled ; we gave three heavy - hearted cheers , and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 23" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Lee Shore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some chapters back , one Bulkington was spoken of , a tall , newlanded mariner , encountered in New Bedford at the inn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When on that shivering winter ' s night , the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves , who should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man , who in mid - winter just landed from a four years ' dangerous voyage , could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The land seemed scorching to his feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable ; deep memories yield no epitaphs ; this six - inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm - tossed ship , that miserably drives along the leeward land ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The port would fain give succor ; the port is pitiful ; in the port is safety , comfort , hearthstone , supper , warm blankets , friends , all that ' s kind to our mortalities ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in that gale , the port , the land , is that ship ' s direst jeopardy ; she must fly all hospitality ; one touch of land , though it but graze the keel , would make her shudder through and through ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With all her might she crowds all sail off shore ; in so doing , fights ' gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed sea ' s landlessness again ; for refuge ' s sake forlornly rushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Know ye now , Bulkington ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth ; that all deep , earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea ; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous , slavish shore ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth , shoreless , indefinite as God -- so , better is it to perish in that howling infinite , than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee , even if that were safety !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For worm - like , then , oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="who would craven crawl to land !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Terrors of the terrible !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="is all this agony so vain ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Up from the spray of thy ocean - perishing -- straight up , leaps thy apotheosis !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 24" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Advocate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling ; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit ; therefore , I am all anxiety to convince ye , ye landsmen , of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the first place , it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact , that among people at large , the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society , it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits , were he presented to the company as a harpooneer , say ; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials S . W . F ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( Sperm Whale Fishery ) to his visiting card , such a procedure would be deemed pre - eminently presuming and ridiculous ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us whalemen , is this : they think that , at best , our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business ; and that when actively engaged therein , we are surrounded by all manner of defilements ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Butchers we are , that is true ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But butchers , also , and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business , ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown , and which , upon the whole , will triumphantly plant the sperm whale - ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But even granting the charge in question to be true ; what disordered slippery decks of a whale - ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle - fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies ' plaudits ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier ' s profession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery , would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale ' s vast tail , fanning into eddies the air over his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , though the world scouts at us whale hunters , yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage ; yea , an all - abounding adoration !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="for almost all the tapers , lamps , and candles that burn round the globe , burn , as before so many shrines , to our glory !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But look at this matter in other lights ; weigh it in all sorts of scales ; see what we whalemen are , and have been ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why did the Dutch in De Witt ' s time have admirals of their whaling fleets ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why did Louis XVI ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="of France , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk , and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of L1 , 000 , 000 ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And lastly , how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world ; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels ; manned by eighteen thousand men ; yearly consuming 4 , 000 , 000 of dollars ; the ships worth , at the time of sailing , $ 20 , 000 , 000 !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $ 7 , 000 , 000 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How comes all this , if there be not something puissant in whaling ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this is not the half ; look again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I freely assert , that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot , for his life , point out one single peaceful influence , which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world , taken in one aggregate , than the high and mighty business of whaling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One way and another , it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves , and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues , that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother , who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It would be a hopeless , endless task to catalogue all these things ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let a handful suffice ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For many years past the whale - ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart , where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If American and European men - of - war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors , let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whale - ship , which originally showed them the way , and first interpreted between them and the savages ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions , your Cooks , your Krusensterns ; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket , that were as great , and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For in their succourless empty - handedness , they , in the heathenish sharked waters , and by the beaches of unrecorded , javelin islands , battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages , those things were but the life - time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Often , adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to , these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship ' s common log ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah , the world !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , the world !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn , no commerce but colonial , scarcely any intercourse but colonial , was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown , touching those colonies ; and , if space permitted , it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru , Chili , and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain , and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That great America on the other side of the sphere , Australia , was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After its first blunder - born discovery by a Dutchman , all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous ; but the whale - ship touched there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whale - ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover , in the infancy of the first Australian settlement , the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale - ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth , and do commercial homage to the whale - ship , that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant , and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If that double - bolted land , Japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale - ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if , in the face of all this , you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it , then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there , and unhorse you with a split helmet every time ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Postscript ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In behalf of the dignity of whaling , I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But after embattling his facts , an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise , which might tell eloquently upon his cause -- such an advocate , would he not be blameworthy ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens , even modern ones , a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is a saltcellar of state , so called , and there may be a castor of state ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How they use the salt , precisely -- who knows ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Certain I am , however , that a king ' s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation , even as a head of salad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can it be , though , that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well , as they anoint machinery ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Much might be ruminated here , concerning the essential dignity of this regal process , because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair , and palpably smells of that anointing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In truth , a mature man who uses hair - oil , unless medicinally , that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="But the only thing to be considered here , is this -- what kind of oil is used at coronations ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Certainly it cannot be olive oil , nor macassar oil , nor castor oil , nor bear ' s oil , nor train oil , nor cod - liver oil ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Knights and Squires ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck , a native of Nantucket , and a Quaker by descent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was a long , earnest man , and though born on an icy coast , seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes , his flesh being hard as twice - baked biscuit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Transported to the Indies , his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine , or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only some thirty arid summers had he seen ; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this , his thinness , so to speak , seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares , than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was merely the condensation of the man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was by no means ill - looking ; quite the contrary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His pure tight skin was an excellent fit ; and closely wrapped up in it , and embalmed with inner health and strength , like a revivified Egyptian , this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come , and to endure always , as now ; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun , like a patent chronometer , his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Looking into his eyes , you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand - fold perils he had calmly confronted through life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A staid , steadfast man , whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action , and not a tame chapter of sounds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude , there were certain qualities in him which at times affected , and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman , and endued with a deep natural reverence , the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition ; but to that sort of superstition , which in some organizations seems rather to spring , somehow , from intelligence than from ignorance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Outward portents and inward presentiments were his ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul , much more did his far - away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child , tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature , and open him still further to those latent influences which , in some honest - hearted men , restrain the gush of dare - devil daring , so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I will have no man in my boat ,&quot; said Starbuck , &quot; who is not afraid of a whale .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye ,&quot; said Stubb , the second mate , &quot; Starbuck , there , is as careful a man as you ' ll find anywhere in this fishery .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But we shall ere long see what that word &quot; careful &quot; precisely means when used by a man like Stubb , or almost any other whale hunter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starbuck was no crusader after perils ; in him courage was not a sentiment ; but a thing simply useful to him , and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be foolishly wasted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun - down ; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , thought Starbuck , I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living , and not to be killed by them for theirs ; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What doom was his own father ' s ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where , in the bottomless deeps , could he find the torn limbs of his brother ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain superstitiousness , as has been said ; the courage of this Starbuck which could , nevertheless , still flourish , must indeed have been extreme ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized , and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had ; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him , which , under suitable circumstances , would break out from its confinement , and burn all his courage up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And brave as he might be , it was that sort of bravery chiefly , visible in some intrepid men , which , while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas , or winds , or whales , or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world , yet cannot withstand those more terrific , because more spiritual terrors , which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance , the complete abasement of poor Starbuck ' s fortitude , scarce might I have the heart to write it ; for it is a thing most sorrowful , nay shocking , to expose the fall of valour in the soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Men may seem detestable as joint stock - companies and nations ; knaves , fools , and murderers there may be ; men may have mean and meagre faces ; but man , in the ideal , is so noble and so sparkling , such a grand and glowing creature , that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves , so far within us , that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone ; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor - ruined man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor can piety itself , at such a shameful sight , completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this august dignity I treat of , is not the dignity of kings and robes , but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike ; that democratic dignity which , on all hands , radiates without end from God ; Himself !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The centre and circumference of all democracy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His omnipresence , our divine equality !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If , then , to meanest mariners , and renegades and castaways , I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities , though dark ; weave round them tragic graces ; if even the most mournful , perchance the most abased , among them all , shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts ; if I shall touch that workman ' s arm with some ethereal light ; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun ; then against all mortal critics bear me out in it , thou Just Spirit of Equality , which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Thou who , in all Thy mighty , earthly marchings , ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons ; bear me out in it , O God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 27" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Knights and Squires ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb was the second mate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was a native of Cape Cod ; and hence , according to local usage , was called a Cape - Cod - man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A happy - go - lucky ; neither craven nor valiant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air ; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase , toiling away , calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Good - humored , easy , and careless , he presided over his whale - boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat , as an old stage - driver is about the snugness of his box ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When close to the whale , in the very death - lock of the fight , he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off - handedly , as a whistling tinker his hammer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Long usage had , for this Stubb , converted the jaws of death into an easy chair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What he thought of death itself , there is no telling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether he ever thought of it at all , might be a question ; but , if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner , no doubt , like a good sailor , he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft , and bestir themselves there , about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order , and not sooner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What , perhaps , with other things , made Stubb such an easy - going , unfearing man , so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars , all bowed to the ground with their packs ; what helped to bring about that almost impious good - humor of his ; that thing must have been his pipe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , like his nose , his short , black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded , stuck in a rack , within easy reach of his hand ; and , whenever he turned in , he smoked them all out in succession , lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter ; then loading them again to be in readiness anew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , when Stubb dressed , instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers , he put his pipe into his mouth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say this continual smoking must have been one cause , at least , of his peculiar disposition ; for every one knows that this earthly air , whether ashore or afloat , is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it ; and as in time of the cholera , some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths ; so , likewise , against all mortal tribulations , Stubb ' s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The third mate was Flask , a native of Tisbury , in Martha ' s Vineyard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A short , stout , ruddy young fellow , very pugnacious concerning whales , who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him ; and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him , to destroy them whenever encountered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ; that in his poor opinion , the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse , or at least water - rat , requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This ignorant , unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales ; he followed these fish for the fun of it ; and a three years ' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As a carpenter ' s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails ; so mankind may be similarly divided ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Little Flask was one of the wrought ones ; made to clinch tight and last long ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They called him King - Post on board of the Pequod ; because , in form , he could be well likened to the short , square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers ; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it , serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now these three mates -- Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask , were momentous men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod ' s boats as headsmen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales , these three headsmen were as captains of companies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or , being armed with their long keen whaling spears , they were as a picked trio of lancers ; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a Gothic Knight of old , is always accompanied by his boat - steerer or harpooneer , who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or elbowed in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally subsists between the two , a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the Pequod ' s harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First of all was Queequeg , whom Starbuck , the chief mate , had selected for his squire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Queequeg is already known ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next was Tashtego , an unmixed Indian from Gay Head , the most westerly promontory of Martha ' s Vineyard , where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men , which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the fishery , they usually go by the generic name of Gay - Headers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tashtego ' s long , lean , sable hair , his high cheek bones , and black rounding eyes -- for an Indian , Oriental in their largeness , but Antarctic in their glittering expression -- all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters , who , in quest of the great New England moose , had scoured , bow in hand , the aboriginal forests of the main ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland , Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea ; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs , you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans , and half - believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tashtego was Stubb the second mate ' s squire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo , a gigantic , coal - black negro - savage , with a lion - like tread -- an Ahasuerus to behold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them ring - bolts , and would talk of securing the top - sail halyards to them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa , Nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues , and erect as a giraffe , moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him ; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Curious to tell , this imperial negro , Ahasuerus Daggoo , was the Squire of little Flask , who looked like a chess - man beside him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for the residue of the Pequod ' s company , be it said , that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery , are Americans born , though pretty nearly all the officers are ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies , and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The same , I say , because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the brains , the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores , where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In like manner , the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London , put in at the Shetland Islands , to receive the full complement of their crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon the passage homewards , they drop them there again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How it is , there is no telling , but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod , ISOLATOES too , I call such , not acknowledging the common continent of men , but each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet now , federated along one keel , what a set these Isolatoes were !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea , and all the ends of the earth , accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world ' s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Black Little Pip -- he never did -- oh , no !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he went before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Poor Alabama boy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the grim Pequod ' s forecastle , ye shall ere long see him , beating his tambourine ; prelusive of the eternal time , when sent for , to the great quarter - deck on high , he was bid strike in with angels , and beat his tambourine in glory ; called a coward here , hailed a hero there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 28" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For several days after leaving Nantucket , nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches , and for aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory , that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , their supreme lord and dictator was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below , I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible ; for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain , now in the seclusion of the sea , became almost a perturbation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah ' s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me , with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But poorly could I withstand them , much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness -- to call it so -- which I felt , yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship , it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For though the harpooneers , with the great body of the crew , were a far more barbaric , heathenish , and motley set than any of the tame merchant - ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with , still I ascribed this -- and rightly ascribed it -- to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship , the mates , which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings , and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Three better , more likely sea - officers and men , each in his own different way , could not readily be found , and they were every one of them Americans ; a Nantucketer , a Vineyarder , a Cape man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor , for a space we had biting Polar weather , though all the time running away from it to the southward ; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed , gradually leaving that merciless winter , and all its intolerable weather behind us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was one of those less lowering , but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition , when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity , that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch , so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail , foreboding shivers ran over me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Reality outran apprehension ; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter - deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him , nor of the recovery from any ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He looked like a man cut away from the stake , when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them , or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His whole high , broad form , seemed made of solid bronze , and shaped in an unalterable mould , like Cellini ' s cast Perseus ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Threading its way out from among his grey hairs , and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck , till it disappeared in his clothing , you saw a slender rod - like mark , lividly whitish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight , lofty trunk of a great tree , when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it , and without wrenching a single twig , peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom , ere running off into the soil , leaving the tree still greenly alive , but branded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether that mark was born with him , or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound , no one could certainly say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By some tacit consent , throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it , especially by the mates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But once Tashtego ' s senior , an old Gay - Head Indian among the crew , superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded , and then it came upon him , not in the fury of any mortal fray , but in an elemental strife at sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived , by what a grey Manxman insinuated , an old sepulchral man , who , having never before sailed out of Nantucket , had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , the old sea - traditions , the immemorial credulities , popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out -- which might hardly come to pass , so he muttered -- then , whoever should do that last office for the dead , would find a birth - mark on him from crown to sole ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me , and the livid brand which streaked it , that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale ' s jaw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , he was dismasted off Japan ,&quot; said the old Gay - Head Indian once ; &quot; but like his dismasted craft , he shipped another mast without coming home for it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has a quiver of ' em .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was struck with the singular posture he maintained ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon each side of the Pequod ' s quarter deck , and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds , there was an auger hole , bored about half an inch or so , into the plank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His bone leg steadied in that hole ; one arm elevated , and holding by a shroud ; Captain Ahab stood erect , looking straight out beyond the ship ' s ever - pitching prow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was an infinity of firmest fortitude , a determinate , unsurrenderable wilfulness , in the fixed and fearless , forward dedication of that glance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not a word he spoke ; nor did his officers say aught to him ; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions , they plainly showed the uneasy , if not painful , consciousness of being under a troubled master - eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And not only that , but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face ; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere long , from his first visit in the air , he withdrew into his cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But after that morning , he was every day visible to the crew ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or seated upon an ivory stool he had ; or heavily walking the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the sky grew less gloomy ; indeed , began to grow a little genial , he became still less and less a recluse ; as if , when the ship had sailed from home , nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , by and by , it came to pass , that he was almost continually in the air ; but , as yet , for all that he said , or perceptibly did , on the at last sunny deck , he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the Pequod was only making a passage now ; not regularly cruising ; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to , so that there was little or nothing , out of himself , to employ or excite Ahab , now ; and thus chase away , for that one interval , the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow , as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , ere long , the warm , warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant , holiday weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , as when the red - cheeked , dancing girls , April and May , trip home to the wintry , misanthropic woods ; even the barest , ruggedest , most thunder - cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts , to welcome such glad - hearted visitants ; so Ahab did , in the end , a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 29" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Enter Ahab ; to Him , Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some days elapsed , and ice and icebergs all astern , the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring , which , at sea , almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The warmly cool , clear , ringing , perfumed , overflowing , redundant days , were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet , heaped up -- flaked up , with rose - water snow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets , nursing at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent conquering Earls , the golden helmeted suns !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For sleeping man , ' twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Inward they turned upon the soul , especially when the still mild hours of eve came on ; then , memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on Ahab ' s texture ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Old age is always wakeful ; as if , the longer linked with life , the less man has to do with aught that looks like death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Among sea - commanders , the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night - cloaked deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was so with Ahab ; only that now , of late , he seemed so much to live in the open air , that truly speaking , his visits were more to the cabin , than from the cabin to the planks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It feels like going down into one ' s tomb ,&quot;-- he would mutter to himself --&quot; for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle , to go to my grave - dug berth .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , almost every twenty - four hours , when the watches of the night were set , and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below ; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle , the sailors flung it not rudely down , as by day , but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates ; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail , habitually , the silent steersman would watch the cabin - scuttle ; and ere long the old man would emerge , gripping at the iron banister , to help his crippled way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some considering touch of humanity was in him ; for at times like these , he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter - deck ; because to his wearied mates , seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel , such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step , that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But once , the mood was on him too deep for common regardings ; and as with heavy , lumber - like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast , Stubb , the old second mate , came up from below , with a certain unassured , deprecating humorousness , hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks , then , no one could say nay ; but there might be some way of muffling the noise ; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow , and the insertion into it , of the ivory heel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb , thou didst not know Ahab then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Am I a cannon - ball , Stubb ,&quot; said Ahab , &quot; that thou wouldst wad me that fashion ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But go thy ways ; I had forgot ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Below to thy nightly grave ; where such as ye sleep between shrouds , to use ye to the filling one at last .-- Down , dog , and kennel !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man , Stubb was speechless a moment ; then said excitedly , &quot; I am not used to be spoken to that way , sir ; I do but less than half like it , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Avast !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="gritted Ahab between his set teeth , and violently moving away , as if to avoid some passionate temptation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , sir ; not yet ,&quot; said Stubb , emboldened , &quot; I will not tamely be called a dog , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule , and an ass , and begone , or I ' ll clear the world of thee !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As he said this , Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect , that Stubb involuntarily retreated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it ,&quot; muttered Stubb , as he found himself descending the cabin - scuttle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It ' s very queer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stop , Stubb ; somehow , now , I don ' t well know whether to go back and strike him , or -- what ' s that ?-- down here on my knees and pray for him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time I ever DID pray ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s queer ; very queer ; and he ' s queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he ' s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How he flashed at me !-- his eyes like powder - pans !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="is he mad ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Anyway there ' s something on his mind , as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He aint in his bed now , either , more than three hours out of the twenty - four ; and he don ' t sleep then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Didn ' t that Dough - Boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man ' s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled , and the sheets down at the foot , and the coverlid almost tied into knots , and the pillow a sort of frightful hot , as though a baked brick had been on it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A hot old man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I guess he ' s got what some folks ashore call a conscience ; it ' s a kind of Tic - Dolly - row they say -- worse nor a toothache ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , well ; I don ' t know what it is , but the Lord keep me from catching it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ' s full of riddles ; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for , every night , as Dough - Boy tells me he suspects ; what ' s that for , I should like to know ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who ' s made appointments with him in the hold ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ain ' t that queer , now ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there ' s no telling , it ' s the old game -- Here goes for a snooze ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Damn me , it ' s worth a fellow ' s while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now that I think of it , that ' s about the first thing babies do , and that ' s a sort of queer , too ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Damn me , but all things are queer , come to think of ' em ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But that ' s against my principles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth -- So here goes again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But how ' s that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="didn ' t he call me a dog ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="blazes !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he called me ten times a donkey , and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He might as well have kicked me , and done with it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Maybe he DID kick me , and I didn ' t observe it , I was so taken all aback with his brow , somehow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It flashed like a bleached bone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What the devil ' s the matter with me ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I don ' t stand right on my legs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the Lord , I must have been dreaming , though -- How ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how ?-- but the only way ' s to stash it ; so here goes to hammock again ; and in the morning , I ' ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 30" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pipe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When Stubb had departed , Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks ; and then , as had been usual with him of late , calling a sailor of the watch , he sent him below for his ivory stool , and also his pipe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck , he sat and smoked ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In old Norse times , the thrones of the sea - loving Danish kings were fabricated , saith tradition , of the tusks of the narwhale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How could one look at Ahab then , seated on that tripod of bones , without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a Khan of the plank , and a king of the sea , and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some moments passed , during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs , which blew back again into his face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; How now ,&quot; he soliloquized at last , withdrawing the tube , &quot; this smoking no longer soothes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , my pipe !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here have I been unconsciously toiling , not pleasuring -- aye , and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while ; to windward , and with such nervous whiffs , as if , like the dying whale , my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What business have I with this pipe ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This thing that is meant for sereneness , to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs , not among torn iron - grey locks like mine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll smoke no more --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The fire hissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With slouched hat , Ahab lurchingly paced the planks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 31" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queen Mab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next morning Stubb accosted Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Such a queer dream , King - Post , I never had ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You know the old man ' s ivory leg , well I dreamed he kicked me with it ; and when I tried to kick back , upon my soul , my little man , I kicked my leg right off !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And then , presto !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab seemed a pyramid , and I , like a blazing fool , kept kicking at it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what was still more curious , Flask -- you know how curious all dreams are -- through all this rage that I was in , I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself , that after all , it was not much of an insult , that kick from Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Why ,' thinks I , ' what ' s the row ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s not a real leg , only a false leg .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And there ' s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ' s what makes a blow from the hand , Flask , fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The living member -- that makes the living insult , my little man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thinks I to myself all the while , mind , while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid -- so confoundedly contradictory was it all , all the while , I say , I was thinking to myself , ' what ' s his leg now , but a cane -- a whalebone cane ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes ,' thinks I , ' it was only a playful cudgelling -- in fact , only a whaleboning that he gave me -- not a base kick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides ,' thinks I , ' look at it once ; why , the end of it -- the foot part -- what a small sort of end it is ; whereas , if a broad footed farmer kicked me , THERE ' S a devilish broad insult ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this insult is whittled down to a point only .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But now comes the greatest joke of the dream , Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While I was battering away at the pyramid , a sort of badger - haired old merman , with a hump on his back , takes me by the shoulders , and slews me round ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' What are you ' bout ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="says he ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Slid !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="man , but I was frightened ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such a phiz !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , somehow , next moment I was over the fright ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' What am I about ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="says I at last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' And what business is that of yours , I should like to know , Mr . Humpback ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do YOU want a kick ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the lord , Flask , I had no sooner said that , than he turned round his stern to me , bent over , and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout -- what do you think , I saw ?-- why thunder alive , man , his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes , with the points out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Says I , on second thoughts , ' I guess I won ' t kick you , old fellow .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Wise Stubb ,' said he , ' wise Stubb ;' and kept muttering it all the time , a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing he wasn ' t going to stop saying over his ' wise Stubb , wise Stubb ,' I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I had only just lifted my foot for it , when he roared out , ' Stop that kicking !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Halloa ,' says I , ' what ' s the matter now , old fellow ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Look ye here ,' says he ; ' let ' s argue the insult ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Ahab kicked ye , didn ' t he ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Yes , he did ,' says I --' right HERE it was .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Very good ,' says he --' he used his ivory leg , didn ' t he ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Yes , he did ,' says I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Well then ,' says he , ' wise Stubb , what have you to complain of ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Didn ' t he kick with right good will ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="it wasn ' t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with , was it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s an honour ; I consider it an honour ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Listen , wise Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen , and made garter - knights of ; but , be YOUR boast , Stubb , that ye were kicked by old Ahab , and made a wise man of ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Remember what I say ; BE kicked by him ; account his kicks honours ; and on no account kick back ; for you can ' t help yourself , wise Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t you see that pyramid ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With that , he all of a sudden seemed somehow , in some queer fashion , to swim off into the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I snored ; rolled over ; and there I was in my hammock !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , what do you think of that dream , Flask ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I don ' t know ; it seems a sort of foolish to me , tho .'&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; May be ; may be ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it ' s made a wise man of me , Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="D ' ye see Ahab standing there , sideways looking over the stern ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , the best thing you can do , Flask , is to let the old man alone ; never speak to him , whatever he says ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Halloa !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s that he shouts ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hark !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mast - head , there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look sharp , all of ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are whales hereabouts !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If ye see a white one , split your lungs for him !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What do you think of that now , Flask ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ain ' t there a small drop of something queer about that , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A white whale -- did ye mark that , man ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look ye -- there ' s something special in the wind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stand by for it , Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab has that that ' s bloody on his mind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , mum ; he comes this way .&quot;" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Cetology ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Already we are boldly launched upon the deep ; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored , harbourless immensities ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere that come to pass ; ere the Pequod ' s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan ; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera , that I would now fain put before you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet is it no easy task ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The classification of the constituents of a chaos , nothing less is here essayed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology ,&quot; says Captain Scoresby , A . D . 1820 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It is not my intention , were it in my power , to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families .... Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal &quot; ( sperm whale ), says Surgeon Beale , A . D . 1839 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; A field strewn with thorns .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus speak of the whale , the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and Lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , though of real knowledge there be little , yet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small degree , with cetology , or the science of whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Many are the men , small and great , old and new , landsmen and seamen , who have at large or in little , written of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Run over a few :-- The Authors of the Bible ; Aristotle ; Pliny ; Aldrovandi ; Sir Thomas Browne ; Gesner ; Ray ; Linnaeus ; Rondeletius ; Willoughby ; Green ; Artedi ; Sibbald ; Brisson ; Marten ; Lacepede ; Bonneterre ; Desmarest ; Baron Cuvier ; Frederick Cuvier ; John Hunter ; Owen ; Scoresby ; Beale ; Bennett ; J . Ross Browne ; the Author of Miriam Coffin ; Olmstead ; and the Rev ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="T . Cheever ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written , the above cited extracts will show ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of the names in this list of whale authors , only those following Owen ever saw living whales ; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I mean Captain Scoresby ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the separate subject of the Greenland or right - whale , he is the best existing authority ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And here be it said , that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is not even by any means the largest of the whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , owing to the long priority of his claims , and the profound ignorance which , till some seventy years back , invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm - whale , and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale - ports ; this usurpation has been every way complete ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days , will satisfy you that the Greenland whale , without one rival , was to them the monarch of the seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the time has at last come for a new proclamation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This is Charing Cross ; hear ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="good people all ,-- the Greenland whale is deposed ,-- the great sperm whale now reigneth !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Those books are Beale ' s and Bennett ' s ; both in their time surgeons to English South - Sea whale - ships , and both exact and reliable men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to scientific description ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Far above all other hunted whales , his is an unwritten life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification , if only an easy outline one for the present , hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As no better man advances to take this matter in hand , I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I promise nothing complete ; because any human thing supposed to be complete , must for that very reason infallibly be faulty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species , or -- in this place at least -- to much of any description ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I am the architect , not the builder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary letter - sorter in the Post - Office is equal to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them ; to have one ' s hands among the unspeakable foundations , ribs , and very pelvis of the world ; this is a fearful thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Will he the ( leviathan ) make a covenant with thee ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Behold the hope of him is vain !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans ; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; I am in earnest ; and I will try ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are some preliminaries to settle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : The uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In his System of Nature , A . D . 1776 , Linnaeus declares , &quot; I hereby separate the whales from the fish .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But of my own knowledge , I know that down to the year 1850 , sharks and shad , alewives and herring , against Linnaeus ' s express edict , were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters , he states as follows : &quot; On account of their warm bilocular heart , their lungs , their movable eyelids , their hollow ears , penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem ,&quot; and finally , &quot; ex lege naturae jure meritoque .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin , of Nantucket , both messmates of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Charley profanely hinted they were humbug ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be it known that , waiving all argument , I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy Jonah to back me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This fundamental thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Above , Linnaeus has given you those items ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next : how shall we define the whale , by his obvious externals , so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To be short , then , a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There you have him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However contracted , that definition is the result of expanded meditation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A walrus spouts much like a whale , but the walrus is not a fish , because he is amphibious ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the last term of the definition is still more cogent , as coupled with the first ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat , but a vertical , or up - and - down tail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whereas , among spouting fish the tail , though it may be similarly shaped , invariably assumes a horizontal position ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the above definition of what a whale is , I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* Hence , all the smaller , spouting , and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground - plan of Cetology ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* I am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs ( Pig - fish and Sow - fish of the Coffins of Nantucket ) are included by many naturalists among the whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as these pig - fish are a noisy , contemptible set , mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers , and feeding on wet hay , and especially as they do not spout , I deny their credentials as whales ; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS ( subdivisible into CHAPTERS ), and these shall comprehend them all , both small and large ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="THE FOLIO WHALE ; II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the OCTAVO WHALE ; III ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the DUODECIMO WHALE ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE ; of the OCTAVO , the GRAMPUS ; of the DUODECIMO , the PORPOISE ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="FOLIOS ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Among these I here include the following chapters :-- I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The SPERM WHALE ; II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the RIGHT WHALE ; III ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the FIN - BACK WHALE ; IV ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the HUMP - BACKED WHALE ; V . the RAZOR - BACK WHALE ; VI ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the SULPHUR - BOTTOM WHALE ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( FOLIO ), CHAPTER I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( SPERM WHALE ).-- This whale , among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale , and the Physeter whale , and the Anvil Headed whale , is the present Cachalot of the French , and the Pottsfich of the Germans , and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is , without doubt , the largest inhabitant of the globe ; the most formidable of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and lastly , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is obtained ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All his peculiarities will , in many other places , be enlarged upon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Philologically considered , it is absurd ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some centuries ago , when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In those times , also , spermaceti was exceedingly scarce , not being used for light , but only as an ointment and medicament ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When , as I opine , in the course of time , the true nature of spermaceti became known , its original name was still retained by the dealers ; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( FOLIO ), CHAPTER II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( RIGHT WHALE ).-- In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as &quot; whale oil ,&quot; an inferior article in commerce ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Among the fishermen , he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles : The Whale ; the Greenland Whale ; the Black Whale ; the Great Whale ; the True Whale ; the Right Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What then is the whale , which I include in the second species of my Folios ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists ; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen ; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen ; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas ; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean , on the Brazil Banks , on the Nor ' West Coast , and various other parts of the world , designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But they precisely agree in all their grand features ; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences , that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to elucidating the sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( FOLIO ), CHAPTER III ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( FIN - BACK ).-- Under this head I reckon a monster which , by the various names of Fin - Back , Tall - Spout , and Long - John , has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic , in the New York packet - tracks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the length he attains , and in his baleen , the Fin - back resembles the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter colour , approaching to olive ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His great lips present a cable - like aspect , formed by the intertwisting , slanting folds of large wrinkles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His grand distinguishing feature , the fin , from which he derives his name , is often a conspicuous object ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This fin is some three or four feet long , growing vertically from the hinder part of the back , of an angular shape , and with a very sharp pointed end ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon - like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour - lines graved on it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On that Ahaz - dial the shadow often goes back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Fin - Back is not gregarious ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He seems a whale - hater , as some men are man - haters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Very shy ; always going solitary ; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters ; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain ; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming , as to defy all present pursuit from man ; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race , bearing for his mark that style upon his back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From having the baleen in his mouth , the Fin - Back is sometimes included with the right whale , among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES , that is , whales with baleen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of these so called Whalebone whales , there would seem to be several varieties , most of which , however , are little known ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Broad - nosed whales and beaked whales ; pike - headed whales ; bunched whales ; under - jawed whales and rostrated whales , are the fishermen ' s names for a few sorts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In connection with this appellative of &quot; Whalebone whales ,&quot; it is of great importance to mention , that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales , yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan , founded upon either his baleen , or hump , or fin , or teeth ; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions , which the whale , in his kinds , presents ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How then ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The baleen , hump , back - fin , and teeth ; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales , without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale , each has a hump ; but there the similitude ceases ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the similitude ceases ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On this rock every one of the whale - naturalists has split ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it may possibly be conceived that , in the internal parts of the whale , in his anatomy -- there , at least , we shall be able to hit the right classification ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nay ; what thing , for example , is there in the Greenland whale ' s anatomy more striking than his baleen ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans , why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What then remains ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire liberal volume , and boldly sort them that way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted ; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed , for it alone is practicable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To proceed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( FOLIO ) CHAPTER IV ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( HUMP - BACK ).-- This whale is often seen on the northern American coast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has been frequently captured there , and towed into harbor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has a great pack on him like a peddler ; or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At any rate , the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him , since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His oil is not very valuable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has baleen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is the most gamesome and light - hearted of all the whales , making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( FOLIO ), CHAPTER V ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( RAZOR - BACK ).-- Of this whale little is known but his name ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of a retiring nature , he eludes both hunters and philosophers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though no coward , he has never yet shown any part of him but his back , which rises in a long sharp ridge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let him go ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know little more of him , nor does anybody else ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( FOLIO ), CHAPTER VI ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( SULPHUR - BOTTOM ).-- Another retiring gentleman , with a brimstone belly , doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is seldom seen ; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas , and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is never chased ; he would run away with rope - walks of line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Prodigies are told of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Adieu , Sulphur Bottom !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I can say nothing more that is true of ye , nor can the oldest Nantucketer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus ends BOOK I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( FOLIO ), and now begins BOOK II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( OCTAVO )." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="OCTAVOES ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*-- These embrace the whales of middling magnitude , among which present may be numbered :-- I ., the GRAMPUS ; II ., the BLACK FISH ; III ., the NARWHALE ; IV ., the THRASHER ; V ., the KILLER ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because , while the whales of this order , though smaller than those of the former order , nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure , yet the bookbinder ' s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume , but the Octavo volume does ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( GRAMPUS ).-- Though this fish , whose loud sonorous breathing , or rather blowing , has furnished a proverb to landsmen , is so well known a denizen of the deep , yet is he not popularly classed among whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan , most naturalists have recognised him for one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is of moderate octavo size , varying from fifteen to twenty - five feet in length , and of corresponding dimensions round the waist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He swims in herds ; he is never regularly hunted , though his oil is considerable in quantity , and pretty good for light ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( BLACK FISH ).-- I give the popular fishermen ' s names for all these fish , for generally they are the best ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive , I shall say so , and suggest another ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I do so now , touching the Black Fish , so - called , because blackness is the rule among almost all whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , call him the Hyena Whale , if you please ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His voracity is well known , and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards , he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is found in almost all latitudes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming , which looks something like a Roman nose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When not more profitably employed , the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale , to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment -- as some frugal housekeepers , in the absence of company , and quite alone by themselves , burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though their blubber is very thin , some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER III ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( NARWHALE ), that is , NOSTRIL WHALE .-- Another instance of a curiously named whale , so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The creature is some sixteen feet in length , while its horn averages five feet , though some exceed ten , and even attain to fifteen feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Strictly speaking , this horn is but a lengthened tusk , growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it is only found on the sinister side , which has an ill effect , giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left - handed man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers , it would be hard to say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword - fish and bill - fish ; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice - piercer ; for the Narwhale , rising to the surface of the Polar Sea , and finding it sheeted with ice , thrusts his horn up , and so breaks through ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My own opinion is , that however this one - sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale -- however that may be -- it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale , the Horned whale , and the Unicorn whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea - unicorn ' s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison , and as such , preparations of it brought immense prices ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies , the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage , when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace , as his bold ship sailed down the Thames ; &quot; when Sir Martin returned from that voyage ,&quot; saith Black Letter , &quot; on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale , which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester , on bended knees , did likewise present to her highness another horn , pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Narwhale has a very picturesque , leopard - like look , being of a milk - white ground colour , dotted with round and oblong spots of black ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His oil is very superior , clear and fine ; but there is little of it , and he is seldom hunted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER IV ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( KILLER ).-- Of this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer , and nothing at all to the professed naturalist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From what I have seen of him at a distance , I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is very savage -- a sort of Feegee fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip , and hangs there like a leech , till the mighty brute is worried to death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Killer is never hunted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I never heard what sort of oil he has ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale , on the ground of its indistinctness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For we are all killers , on land and on sea ; Bonapartes and Sharks included ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER V ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( THRASHER ).-- This gentleman is famous for his tail , which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He mounts the Folio whale ' s back , and as he swims , he works his passage by flogging him ; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Both are outlaws , even in the lawless seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus ends BOOK II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( OCTAVO ), and begins BOOK III ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( DUODECIMO )." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="DUODECIMOES .-- These include the smaller whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Huzza Porpoise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Algerine Porpoise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="III ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Mealy - mouthed Porpoise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject , it may possibly seem strange , that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES -- a word , which , in the popular sense , always conveys an idea of hugeness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales , by the terms of my definition of what a whale is -- i . e ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a spouting fish , with a horizontal tail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="BOOK III ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER 1 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( HUZZA PORPOISE ).-- This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The name is of my own bestowal ; for there are more than one sort of porpoises , and something must be done to distinguish them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I call him thus , because he always swims in hilarious shoals , which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth - of - July crowd ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Full of fine spirits , they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They are the lads that always live before the wind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They are accounted a lucky omen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish , then heaven help ye ; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A well - fed , plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="In shape , he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise , being of a less rotund and jolly girth ; indeed , he is of quite a neat and gentleman - like figure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has no fins on his back ( most other porpoises have ), he has a lovely tail , and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable , yet a boundary line , distinct as the mark in a ship ' s hull , called the &quot; bright waist ,&quot; that line streaks him from stem to stern , with two separate colours , black above and white below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The white comprises part of his head , and the whole of his mouth , which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal - bag ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="CHAPTER 33" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Specksynder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Concerning the officers of the whale - craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship - board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale - fleet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The large importance attached to the harpooneer ' s vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old Dutch Fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Literally this word means Fat - Cutter ; usage , however , in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In those days , the captain ' s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel ; while over the whale - hunting department and all its concerns , the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the British Greenland Fishery , under the corrupted title of Specksioneer , this old Dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly abridged ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer ; and as such , is but one of the captain ' s more inferior subalterns ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances ( night watches on a whaling ground ) the command of the ship ' s deck is also his ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands , that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this -- the first lives aft , the last forward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hence , in whale - ships and merchantmen alike , the mates have their quarters with the captain ; and so , too , in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That is to say , they take their meals in the captain ' s cabin , and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage ( by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man ), the peculiar perils of it , and the community of interest prevailing among a company , all of whom , high or low , depend for their profits , not upon fixed wages , but upon their common luck , together with their common vigilance , intrepidity , and hard work ; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally ; yet , never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may , in some primitive instances , live together ; for all that , the punctilious externals , at least , of the quarter - deck are seldom materially relaxed , and in no instance done away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Indeed , many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter - deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot - cloth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption ; and though the only homage he ever exacted , was implicit , instantaneous obedience ; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter - deck ; and though there were times when , owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed , he addressed them in unusual terms , whether of condescension or IN TERROREM , or otherwise ; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , perhaps , will it fail to be eventually perceived , that behind those forms and usages , as it were , he sometimes masked himself ; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For be a man ' s intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This it is , that for ever keeps God ' s true princes of the Empire from the world ' s hustings ; and leaves the highest honours that this air can give , to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert , than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them , that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when , as in the case of Nicholas the Czar , the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain ; then , the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing , ever forget a hint , incidentally so important in his art , as the one now alluded to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Ahab , my Captain , still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess ; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings , I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale - hunter like him ; and , therefore , all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , Ahab !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what shall be grand in thee , it must needs be plucked at from the skies , and dived for in the deep , and featured in the unbodied air !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 34" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Cabin - Table ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is noon ; and Dough - Boy , the steward , thrusting his pale loaf - of - bread face from the cabin - scuttle , announces dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee quarter - boat , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth , medallion - shaped tablet , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From his complete inattention to the tidings , you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But presently , catching hold of the mizen shrouds , he swings himself to the deck , and in an even , unexhilarated voice , saying , &quot; Dinner , Mr . Starbuck ,&quot; disappears into the cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the last echo of his sultan ' s step has died away , and Starbuck , the first Emir , has every reason to suppose that he is seated , then Starbuck rouses from his quietude , takes a few turns along the planks , and , after a grave peep into the binnacle , says , with some touch of pleasantness , &quot; Dinner , Mr . Stubb ,&quot; and descends the scuttle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile , and then slightly shaking the main brace , to see whether it will be all right with that important rope , he likewise takes up the old burden , and with a rapid &quot; Dinner , Mr . Flask ,&quot; follows after his predecessors ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the third Emir , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter - deck , seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint ; for , tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions , and kicking off his shoes , he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk ' s head ; and then , by a dexterous sleight , pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf , he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck , reversing all other processions , by bringing up the rear with music ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below , he pauses , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab ' s presence , in the character of Abjectus , or the Slave ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea - usages , that while in the open air of the deck some officers will , upon provocation , bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander ; yet , ten to one , let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander ' s cabin , and straightway their inoffensive , not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him , as he sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous , sometimes most comical ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherefore this difference ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A problem ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Perhaps not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To have been Belshazzar , King of Babylon ; and to have been Belshazzar , not haughtily but courteously , therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner - table of invited guests , that man ' s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time ; that man ' s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar ' s , for Belshazzar was not the greatest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who has but once dined his friends , has tasted what it is to be Caesar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship - master , then , by inference , you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea - life just mentioned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Over his ivory - inlaid table , Ahab presided like a mute , maned sea - lion on the white coral beach , surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In his own proper turn , each officer waited to be served ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were as little children before Ahab ; and yet , in Ahab , there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man ' s knife , as he carved the chief dish before him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation , even upon so neutral a topic as the weather ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when reaching out his knife and fork , between which the slice of beef was locked , Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck ' s plate towards him , the mate received his meat as though receiving alms ; and cut it tenderly ; and a little started if , perchance , the knife grazed against the plate ; and chewed it noiselessly ; and swallowed it , not without circumspection ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort , where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors , so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals , eaten in awful silence ; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation ; only he himself was dumb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What a relief it was to choking Stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And poor little Flask , he was the youngest son , and little boy of this weary family party ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His were the shinbones of the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For Flask to have presumed to help himself , this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , Ahab never forbade him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And had Flask helped himself , the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Least of all , did Flask presume to help himself to butter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him , on account of its clotting his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such marketless waters , butter was at a premium , and therefore was not for him , a subaltern ; however it was , Flask , alas !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was a butterless man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Another thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Flask was the last person down at the dinner , and Flask is the first man up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consider !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For hereby Flask ' s dinner was badly jammed in point of time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If Stubb even , who is but a peg higher than Flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then Flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Peace and satisfaction , thought Flask , have for ever departed from my stomach ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I am an officer ; but , how I wish I could fish a bit of old - fashioned beef in the forecastle , as I used to when I was before the mast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s the fruits of promotion now ; there ' s the vanity of glory : there ' s the insanity of life !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask ' s official capacity , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain ample vengeance , was to go aft at dinner - time , and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky - light , sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod ' s cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast , they being its residuary legatees ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They made a sort of temporary servants ' hall of the high and mighty cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain ' s table , was the entire care - free license and ease , the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While their masters , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego , that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast , often the pale Dough - Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt - junk , seemingly quarried out of the solid ox ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop - skip - and - jump , then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon - wise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And once Daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , assisted Dough - Boy ' s memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while Tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was naturally a very nervous , shuddering sort of little fellow , this bread - faced steward ; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab , and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages , Dough - Boy ' s whole life was one continual lip - quiver ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Commonly , after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded , he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining , and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego , opposing his filed teeth to the Indian ' s : crosswise to them , Daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his hearse - plumed head to the low carlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin framework to shake , as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But for all this , the great negro was wonderfully abstemious , not to say dainty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad , baronial , and superb a person ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , doubtless , this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air ; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not by beef or by bread , are giants made or nourished ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric smack of the lip in eating -- an ugly sound enough -- so much so , that the trembling Dough - Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the simple - witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry , by his sudden fits of the palsy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets , for their lances and other weapons ; and with which whetstones , at dinner , they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives ; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough - Boy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How could he forget that in his Island days , Queequeg , for one , must certainly have been guilty of some murderous , convivial indiscretions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Alas !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dough - Boy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not a napkin should he carry on his arm , but a buckler ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In good time , though , to his great delight , the three salt - sea warriors would rise and depart ; to his credulous , fable - mongering ears , all their martial bones jingling in them at every step , like Moorish scimetars in scabbards ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , though these barbarians dined in the cabin , and nominally lived there ; still , being anything but sedentary in their habits , they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes , and just before sleeping - time , when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this one matter , Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains , who , as a set , rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship ' s cabin belongs to them ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is , at any time , permitted there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that , in real truth , the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For when they did enter it , it was something as a street - door enters a house ; turning inwards for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , residing in the open air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially , Ahab was inaccessible ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though nominally included in the census of Christendom , he was still an alien to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He lived in the world , as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as when Spring and Summer had departed , that wild Logan of the woods , burying himself in the hollow of a tree , lived out the winter there , sucking his own paws ; so , in his inclement , howling old age , Ahab ' s soul , shut up in the caved trunk of his body , there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 35" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Mast - Head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast - head came round ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In most American whalemen the mast - heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel ' s leaving her port ; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles , and more , to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if , after a three , four , or five years ' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her -- say , an empty vial even -- then , her mast - heads are kept manned to the last ; and not till her skysail - poles sail in among the spires of the port , does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , as the business of standing mast - heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I take it , that the earliest standers of mast - heads were the old Egyptians ; because , in all my researches , I find none prior to them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For though their progenitors , the builders of Babel , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast - head in all Asia , or Africa either ; yet ( ere the final truck was put to it ) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of God ' s wrath ; therefore , we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast - head standers , is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists , that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair - like formation of all four sides of those edifices ; whereby , with prodigious long upliftings of their legs , those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex , and sing out for new stars ; even as the look - outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing in sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In Saint Stylites , the famous Christian hermit of old times , who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander - of - mast - heads ; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of modern standers - of - mast - heads we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron , and bronze men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale , are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is Napoleon ; who , upon the top of the column of Vendome , stands with arms folded , some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below ; whether Louis Philippe , Louis Blanc , or Louis the Devil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Great Washington , too , stands high aloft on his towering main - mast in Baltimore , and like one of Hercules ' pillars , his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Admiral Nelson , also , on a capstan of gun - metal , stands his mast - head in Trafalgar Square ; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But neither great Washington , nor Napoleon , nor Nelson , will answer a single hail from below , however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be surmised , that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future , and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast - head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy , the sole historian of Nantucket , stands accountable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The worthy Obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea - coast , to which the look - outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen - house ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready - manned boats nigh the beach ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the one proper mast - head , that of a whale - ship at sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The three mast - heads are kept manned from sun - rise to sun - set ; the seamen taking their regular turns ( as at the helm ), and relieving each other every two hours ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast - head ; nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing ruffled but the waves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner -- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In one of those southern whalesmen , on a long three or four years ' voyage , as often happens , the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast - head would amount to several entire months ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness , or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling , such as pertains to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a sentry box , a pulpit , a coach , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t ' gallant - mast , where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks ( almost peculiar to whalemen ) called the t ' gallant cross - trees ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , tossed about by the sea , the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull ' s horns ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch - coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch - coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and cannot freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing ( like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter ); so a watch - coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch - coat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Concerning all this , it is much to be deplored that the mast - heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits , called CROW ' S - NESTS , in which the look - outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet , entitled &quot; A Voyage among the Icebergs , in quest of the Greenland Whale , and incidentally for the re - discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland ;&quot; in this admirable volume , all standers of mast - heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented CROW ' S - NEST of the Glacier , which was the name of Captain Sleet ' s good craft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He called it the SLEET ' S CROW ' S - NEST , in honour of himself ; he being the original inventor and patentee , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names ( we fathers being the original inventors and patentees ), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In shape , the Sleet ' s crow ' s - nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a movable side - screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Being fixed on the summit of the mast , you ascend into it through a little trap - hatch in the bottom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker underneath for umbrellas , comforters , and coats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , telescope , and other nautical conveniences ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast - head in this crow ' s - nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him ( also fixed in the rack ), together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe , as he does , all the little detailed conveniences of his crow ' s - nest ; but though he so enlarges upon many of these , and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow ' s - nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the &quot; local attraction &quot; of all binnacle magnets ; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship ' s planks , and in the Glacier ' s case , perhaps , to there having been so many broken - down blacksmiths among her crew ; I say , that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here , yet , for all his learned &quot; binnacle deviations ,&quot; &quot; azimuth compass observations ,&quot; and &quot; approximate errors ,&quot; he knows very well , Captain Sleet , that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case - bottle , so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow ' s nest , within easy reach of his hand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though , upon the whole , I greatly admire and even love the brave , the honest , and learned Captain ; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case - bottle , seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been , while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird ' s nest within three or four perches of the pole ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if we Southern whale - fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were ; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter - balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For one , I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely , resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg , or any one else off duty whom I might find there ; then ascending a little way further , and throwing a lazy leg over the top - sail yard , take a preliminary view of the watery pastures , and so at last mount to my ultimate destination ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let me make a clean breast of it here , and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could I -- being left completely to myself at such a thought - engendering altitude -- how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale - ships ' standing orders , &quot; Keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And let me in this place movingly admonish you , ye ship - owners of Nantucket !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Beware of such an one , I say ; your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this sunken - eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one pint of sperm the richer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor are these monitions at all unneeded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For nowadays , the whale - fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic , melancholy , and absent - minded young men , disgusted with the carking cares of earth , and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast - head of some luckless disappointed whale - ship , and in moody phrase ejaculates :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ten thousand blubber - hunters sweep over thee in vain .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent - minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient &quot; interest &quot; in the voyage ; half - hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all in vain ; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short - sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They have left their opera - glasses at home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why , thou monkey ,&quot; said a harpooneer to one of these lads , &quot; we ' ve been cruising now hard upon three years , and thou hast not raised a whale yet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whales are scarce as hen ' s teeth whenever thou art up here .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium - like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent - minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half - seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly - discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like Crammer ' s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her , borrowed from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable tides of God ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But while this sleep , this dream is on ye , move your foot or hand an inch ; slip your hold at all ; and your identity comes back in horror ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Over Descartian vortices you hover ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And perhaps , at mid - day , in the fairest weather , with one half - throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea , no more to rise for ever ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Heed it well , ye Pantheists !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 36" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Quarter - Deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( ENTER AHAB : THEN , ALL )" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe , that one morning shortly after breakfast , Ahab , as was his wont , ascended the cabin - gangway to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There most sea - captains usually walk at that hour , as country gentlemen , after the same meal , take a few turns in the garden ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon his steady , ivory stride was heard , as to and fro he paced his old rounds , upon planks so familiar to his tread , that they were all over dented , like geological stones , with the peculiar mark of his walk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Did you fixedly gaze , too , upon that ribbed and dented brow ; there also , you would see still stranger foot - prints -- the foot - prints of his one unsleeping , ever - pacing thought ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But on the occasion in question , those dents looked deeper , even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , so full of his thought was Ahab , that at every uniform turn that he made , now at the main - mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely possessing him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; D ' ye mark him , Flask ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="whispered Stubb ; &quot; the chick that ' s in him pecks the shell ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Twill soon be out .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The hours wore on ;-- Ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It drew near the close of day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks , and inserting his bone leg into the auger - hole there , and with one hand grasping a shroud , he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sir !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said the mate , astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship - board except in some extraordinary case ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Send everybody aft ,&quot; repeated Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mast - heads , there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="come down !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the entire ship ' s company were assembled , and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces , were eyeing him , for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up , Ahab , after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks , and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his standpoint ; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With bent head and half - slouched hat he continued to pace , unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men ; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask , that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this did not last long ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Vehemently pausing , he cried :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What do ye do when ye see a whale , men ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sing out for him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Good !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , with a wild approval in his tones ; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And what do ye next , men ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lower away , and after him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And what tune is it ye pull to , men ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; A dead whale or a stove boat !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving , grew the countenance of the old man at every shout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , they were all eagerness again , as Ahab , now half - revolving in his pivot - hole , with one hand reaching high up a shroud , and tightly , almost convulsively grasping it , addressed them thus :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; All ye mast - headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="d ' ye see this Spanish ounce of gold ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun --&quot; it is a sixteen dollar piece , men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="D ' ye see it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mr . Starbuck , hand me yon top - maul .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket , as if to heighten its lustre , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Receiving the top - maul from Starbuck , he advanced towards the main - mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand , exhibiting the gold with the other , and with a high raised voice exclaiming : &quot; Whosoever of ye raises me a white - headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw ; whosoever of ye raises me that white - headed whale , with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke -- look ye , whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale , he shall have this gold ounce , my boys !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Huzza !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="huzza !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the seamen , as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It ' s a white whale , I say ,&quot; resumed Ahab , as he threw down the topmaul : &quot; a white whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Skin your eyes for him , men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but a bubble , sing out .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All this while Tashtego , Daggoo , and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest , and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Ahab ,&quot; said Tashtego , &quot; that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Moby Dick ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shouted Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Do ye know the white whale then , Tash ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Does he fan - tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said the Gay - Header deliberately ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And has he a curious spout , too ,&quot; said Daggoo , &quot; very bushy , even for a parmacetty , and mighty quick , Captain Ahab ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And he have one , two , three -- oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="good many iron in him hide , too , Captain ,&quot; cried Queequeg disjointedly , &quot; all twiske - tee be - twisk , like him -- him --&quot; faltering hard for a word , and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle --&quot; like him -- him --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Corkscrew !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , &quot; aye , Queequeg , the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him ; aye , Daggoo , his spout is a big one , like a whole shock of wheat , and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep - shearing ; aye , Tashtego , and he fan - tails like a split jib in a squall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Death and devils !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="men , it is Moby Dick ye have seen -- Moby Dick -- Moby Dick !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Ahab ,&quot; said Starbuck , who , with Stubb and Flask , had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise , but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Ahab , I have heard of Moby Dick -- but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Who told thee that ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab ; then pausing , &quot; Aye , Starbuck ; aye , my hearties all round ; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me ; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , aye ,&quot; he shouted with a terrific , loud , animal sob , like that of a heart - stricken moose ; &quot; Aye , aye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="it was that accursed white whale that razeed me ; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then tossing both arms , with measureless imprecations he shouted out : &quot; Aye , aye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and I ' ll chase him round Good Hope , and round the Horn , and round the Norway Maelstrom , and round perdition ' s flames before I give him up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this is what ye have shipped for , men !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="to chase that white whale on both sides of land , and over all sides of earth , till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I think ye do look brave .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shouted the harpooneers and seamen , running closer to the excited old man : &quot; A sharp eye for the white whale ; a sharp lance for Moby Dick !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; God bless ye ,&quot; he seemed to half sob and half shout ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; God bless ye , men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Steward !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="go draw the great measure of grog ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what ' s this long face about , Mr . Starbuck ; wilt thou not chase the white whale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="art not game for Moby Dick ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I am game for his crooked jaw , and for the jaws of Death too , Captain Ahab , if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow ; but I came here to hunt whales , not my commander ' s vengeance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it , Captain Ahab ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Nantucket market !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hoot !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But come closer , Starbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If money ' s to be the measurer , man , and the accountants have computed their great counting - house the globe , by girdling it with guineas , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He smites his chest ,&quot; whispered Stubb , &quot; what ' s that for ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="methinks it rings most vast , but hollow .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Vengeance on a dumb brute !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck , &quot; that simply smote thee from blindest instinct !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Madness !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To be enraged with a dumb thing , Captain Ahab , seems blasphemous .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in each event -- in the living act , the undoubted deed -- there , some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Sometimes I think there ' s naught beyond ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ' tis enough ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He tasks me ; he heaps me ; I see in him outrageous strength , with an inscrutable malice sinewing it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate ; and be the white whale agent , or be the white whale principal , I will wreak that hate upon him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Talk not to me of blasphemy , man ; I ' d strike the sun if it insulted me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For could the sun do that , then could I do the other ; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein , jealousy presiding over all creations ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="CHAPTER 41" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I , Ishmael , was one of that crew ; my shouts had gone up with the rest ; my oath had been welded with theirs ; and stronger I shouted , and more did I hammer and clinch my oath , because of the dread in my soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A wild , mystical , sympathetical feeling was in me ; Ahab ' s quenchless feud seemed mine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For some time past , though at intervals only , the unaccompanied , secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not all of them knew of his existence ; only a few of them , comparatively , had knowingly seen him ; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him , was small indeed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , owing to the large number of whale - cruisers ; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference , many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes , so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch , to encounter a single news - telling sail of any sort ; the inordinate length of each separate voyage ; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home ; all these , with other circumstances , direct and indirect , long obstructed the spread through the whole world - wide whaling - fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was hardly to be doubted , that several vessels reported to have encountered , at such or such a time , or on such or such a meridian , a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity , which whale , after doing great mischief to his assailants , had completely escaped them ; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption , I say , that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity , cunning , and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore it was , that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick ; such hunters , perhaps , for the most part , were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred , more , as it were , to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large , than to the individual cause ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as for those who , previously hearing of the White Whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at length , such calamities did ensue in these assaults -- not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles , broken limbs , or devouring amputations -- but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disastrous repulses , all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate , and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events ,-- as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi ; but , in maritime life , far more than in that of terra firma , wild rumors abound , wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter , so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life , in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors ; but of all sailors , they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels , but , hand to jaw , give battle to them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Alone , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any chiseled hearth - stone , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half - formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of the White Whale , few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale , as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale , would perhaps -- either from professional inexperience , or incompetency , or timidity , decline a contest with the Sperm Whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag , who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North ; seated on their hatches , these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of Southern whaling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is the pre - eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended , than on board of those prows which stem him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists -- Olassen and Povelson -- declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier ' s , were these or almost similar impressions effaced ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For in his Natural History , the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale , all fish ( sharks included ) are &quot; struck with the most lively terrors ,&quot; and &quot; often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him , not a few of the fishermen recalled , in reference to Moby Dick , the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery , when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare ; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued , yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That to attempt it , would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On this head , there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , some there were , who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick ; and a still greater number who , chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely , without the specific details of any certain calamity , and without superstitious accompaniments , were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One of the wild suggestions referred to , as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined , was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , credulous as such minds must have been , was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged , even to the most erudite research ; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain , in great part , unaccountable to his pursuers ; and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them , especially concerning the mystic modes whereby , after sounding to a great depth , he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a thing well known to both American and English whale - ships , and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is it to be gainsaid , that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the Nor ' West Passage , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal ( near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface ); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse ( whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage ); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Forced into familiarity , then , with such prodigies as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the White Whale had escaped alive ; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous , but immortal ( for immortality is but ubiquity in time ); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly deception ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his unsullied jet would once more be seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings , there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out -- a peculiar snow - white wrinkled forehead , and a high , pyramidical white hump ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These were his prominent features ; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless , uncharted seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The rest of his body was so streaked , and spotted , and marbled with the same shrouded hue , that , in the end , he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale ; a name , indeed , literally justified by his vivid aspect , when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea , leaving a milky - way wake of creamy foam , all spangled with golden gleamings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was it his unwonted magnitude , nor his remarkable hue , nor yet his deformed lower jaw , that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that unexampled , intelligent malignity which , according to specific accounts , he had over and over again evinced in his assaults ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="More than all , his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , when swimming before his exulting pursuers , with every apparent symptom of alarm , he had several times been known to turn round suddenly , and , bearing down upon them , either stave their boats to splinters , or drive them back in consternation to their ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Already several fatalities had attended his chase ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though similar disasters , however little bruited ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the White Whale ' s infernal aforethought of ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Judge , then , to what pitches of inflamed , distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled , when amid the chips of chewed boats , and the sinking limbs of torn comrades , they swam out of the white curds of the whale ' s direful wrath into the serene , exasperating sunlight , that smiled on , as if at a birth or a bridal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line - knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an Arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom - deep life of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That captain was Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle - shaped lower jaw beneath him , Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab ' s leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No turbaned Turk , no hired Venetian or Malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one - half of the worlds ; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ;-- Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All that most maddens and torments ; all that stirs up the lees of things ; all truth with malice in it ; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain ; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought ; all evil , to crazy Ahab , were visibly personified , and made practically assailable in Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He piled upon the whale ' s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a mortar , he burst his hot heart ' s shell upon it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , passionate , corporal animosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration , but nothing more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , when by this collision forced to turn towards home , and for long months of days and weeks , Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock , rounding in mid winter that dreary , howling Patagonian Cape ; then it was , that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another ; and so interfusing , made him mad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a raving lunatic ; and , though unlimbed of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest , and was moreover intensified by his delirium , that his mates were forced to lace him fast , even there , as he sailed , raving in his hammock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a strait - jacket , he swung to the mad rockings of the gales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild stun ' sails spread , floated across the tranquil tropics , and , to all appearances , the old man ' s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone ; even then , Ahab , in his hidden self , raved on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab ' s full lunacy subsided not , but deepeningly contracted ; like the unabated Hudson , when that noble Northman flows narrowly , but unfathomably through the Highland gorge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , as in his narrow - flowing monomania , not one jot of Ahab ' s broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That before living agent , now became the living instrument ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If such a furious trope may stand , his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it , and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , Ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This is much ; yet Ahab ' s larger , darker , deeper part remains unhinted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But vain to popularize profundities , and all truth is profound ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand -- however grand and wonderful , now quit it ;-- and take your way , ye nobler , sadder souls , to those vast Roman halls of Thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man ' s upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique buried beneath antiquities , and throned on torsoes !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So with a broken throne , the great gods mock that captive king ; so like a Caryatid , he patient sits , upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wind ye down there , ye prouder , sadder souls !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="question that proud , sad king !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A family likeness !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="aye , he did beget ye , ye young exiled royalties ; and from your grim sire only will the old State - secret come ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , in his heart , Ahab had some glimpse of this , namely : all my means are sane , my motive and my object mad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet without power to kill , or change , or shun the fact ; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble ; in some sort , did still ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility , not to his will determinate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , so well did he succeed in that dissembling , that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last , no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved , and that to the quick , with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so too , all the added moodiness which always afterwards , to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage , sat brooding on his brow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is it so very unlikely , that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage , on account of such dark symptoms , the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit , that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge , for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gnawed within and scorched without , with the infixed , unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea ; such an one , could he be found , would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or , if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that , yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But be all this as it may , certain it is , that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him , Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all - engrossing object of hunting the White Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then , how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were bent on profitable cruises , the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was intent on an audacious , immitigable , and supernatural revenge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , then , was this grey - headed , ungodly old man , chasing with curses a Job ' s whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of mongrel renegades , and castaways , and cannibals -- morally enfeebled also , by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right - mindedness in Starbuck , the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb , and the pervading mediocrity in Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such a crew , so officered , seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man ' s ire -- by what evil magic their souls were possessed , that at times his hate seemed almost theirs ; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be -- what the White Whale was to them , or how to their unconscious understandings , also , in some dim , unsuspected way , he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life ,-- all this to explain , would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The subterranean miner that works in us all , how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting , muffled sound of his pick ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What skiff in tow of a seventy - four can stand still ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For one , I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place ; but while yet all a - rush to encounter the whale , could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 42" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Whiteness of The Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What the white whale was to Ahab , has been hinted ; what , at times , he was to me , as yet remains unsaid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick , which could not but occasionally awaken in any man ' s soul some alarm , there was another thought , or rather vague , nameless horror concerning him , which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest ; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it , that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But how can I hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , explain myself I must , else all these chapters might be naught ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though in many natural objects , whiteness refiningly enhances beauty , as if imparting some special virtue of its own , as in marbles , japonicas , and pearls ; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue ; even the barbaric , grand old kings of Pegu placing the title &quot; Lord of the White Elephants &quot; above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion ; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow - white quadruped in the royal standard ; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow - white charger ; and the great Austrian Empire , Caesarian , heir to overlording Rome , having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue ; and though this pre - eminence in it applies to the human race itself , giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe ; and though , besides , all this , whiteness has been even made significant of gladness , for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day ; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings , this same hue is made the emblem of many touching , noble things -- the innocence of brides , the benignity of age ; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour ; though in many climes , whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge , and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk - white steeds ; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power ; by the Persian fire worshippers , the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar ; and in the Greek mythologies , Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow - white bull ; and though to the noble Iroquois , the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology , that spotless , faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity ; and though directly from the Latin word for white , all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture , the alb or tunic , worn beneath the cassock ; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith , white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord ; though in the Vision of St . John , white robes are given to the redeemed , and the four - and - twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great - white throne , and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool ; yet for all these accumulated associations , with whatever is sweet , and honourable , and sublime , there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue , which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This elusive quality it is , which causes the thought of whiteness , when divorced from more kindly associations , and coupled with any object terrible in itself , to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Witness the white bear of the poles , and the white shark of the tropics ; what but their smooth , flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness , even more loathsome than terrific , to the dumb gloating of their aspect ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that not the fierce - fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white - shrouded bear or shark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But even assuming all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that intensified terror ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for the white shark , the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Romish mass for the dead begins with &quot; Requiem eternam &quot; ( eternal rest ), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself , and any other funeral music ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , in allusion to the white , silent stillness of death in this shark , and the mild deadliness of his habits , the French call him REQUIN ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bethink thee of the albatross , whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread , in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not Coleridge first threw that spell ; but God ' s great , unflattering laureate , Nature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* I remember the first albatross I ever saw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From my forenoon watch below , I ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , I saw a regal , feathery thing of unspotted whiteness , and with a hooked , Roman bill sublime ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though bodily unharmed , it uttered cries , as some king ' s ghost in supernatural distress ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Through its inexpressible , strange eyes , methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As Abraham before the angels , I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I cannot tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at last I awoke ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A goney , he replied ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Goney !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="never had heard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="never !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But some time after , I learned that goney was some seaman ' s name for albatross ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that by no possibility could Coleridge ' s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine , when I saw that bird upon our deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For neither had I then read the Rhyme , nor knew the bird to be an albatross ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , in saying this , I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses ; and these I have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But how had the mystic thing been caught ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whisper it not , and I will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last the Captain made a postman of it ; tying a lettered , leathern tally round its neck , with the ship ' s time and place ; and then letting it escape ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing - folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies ; a magnificent milk - white charger , large - eyed , small - headed , bluff - chested , and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty , overscorning carriage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses , whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The flashing cascade of his mane , the curving comet of his tail , invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver - beaters could have furnished him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen , western world , which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god , bluff - browed and fearless as this mighty steed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains , like an Ohio ; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon , the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness ; in whatever aspect he presented himself , always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness ; and that this divineness had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye , as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is that whiteness which invests him , a thing expressed by the name he bears ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Albino is as well made as other men -- has no substantive deformity -- and yet this mere aspect of all - pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why should this be so ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , in quite other aspects , does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies , fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From its snowy aspect , the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , in some historic instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart , when , masked in the snowy symbol of their faction , the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market - place !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It cannot well be doubted , that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer , is the marble pallor lingering there ; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world , as of mortal trepidation here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And from that pallor of the dead , we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in a milk - white fog -- Yea , while these terrors seize us , let us add , that even the king of terrors , when personified by the evangelist , rides on his pallid horse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore , in his other moods , symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though without dissent this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To analyse it , would seem impossible ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can we , then , by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness -- though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to exert over us the same sorcery , however modified ;-- can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let us try ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in a matter like this , subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And though , doubtless , some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men , yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time , and therefore may not be able to recall them now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why to the man of untutored ideality , who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day , does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long , dreary , speechless processions of slow - pacing pilgrims , down - cast and hooded with new - fallen snow ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or , to the unread , unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States , why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun , evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings ( which will not wholly account for it ) that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American , than those other storied structures , its neighbors -- the Byward Tower , or even the Bloody ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And those sublimer towers , the White Mountains of New Hampshire , whence , in peculiar moods , comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name , while the thought of Virginia ' s Blue Ridge is full of a soft , dewy , distant dreaminess ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or , to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance , purely addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe , does &quot; the tall pale man &quot; of the Hartz forests , whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves -- why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is it , altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral - toppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched cope - stones , and crosses all adroop ( like canted yards of anchored fleets ); and her suburban avenues of house - walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of cards ;-- it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima , the strangest , saddest city thou can ' st see ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For Lima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Old as Pizarro , this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new ; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know that , to the common apprehension , this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible ; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon , especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : The mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands , if by night he hear the roar of breakers , starts to vigilance , and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties ; but under precisely similar circumstances , let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness -- as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him , then he feels a silent , superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings ; heart and helm they both go down ; he never rests till blue water is under him again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee , &quot; Sir , it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks , as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Second : To the native Indian of Peru , the continual sight of the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread , except , perhaps , in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes , and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West , who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow , no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not so the sailor , beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas ; where at times , by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air , he , shivering and half shipwrecked , instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery , views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But thou sayest , methinks that white - lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo , Ishmael ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tell me , why this strong young colt , foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont , far removed from all beasts of prey -- why is it that upon the sunniest day , if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him , so that he cannot even see it , but only smells its wild animal muskiness -- why will he start , snort , and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home , so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils ; for what knows he , this New England colt , of the black bisons of distant Oregon ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No ; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute , the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though thousands of miles from Oregon , still when he smells that savage musk , the rending , goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies , which this instant they may be trampling into dust ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , then , the muffled rollings of a milky sea ; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains ; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies ; all these , to Ishmael , are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints ; yet with me , as with the colt , somewhere those things must exist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love , the invisible spheres were formed in fright ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness , and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul ; and more strange and far more portentous -- why , as we have seen , it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things , nay , the very veil of the Christian ' s Deity ; and yet should be as it is , the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe , and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or is it , that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour ; and at the same time the concrete of all colours ; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness , full of meaning , in a wide landscape of snows -- a colourless , all - colour of atheism from which we shrink ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers , that all other earthly hues -- every stately or lovely emblazoning -- the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods ; yea , and the gilded velvets of butterflies , and the butterfly cheeks of young girls ; all these are but subtile deceits , not actually inherent in substances , but only laid on from without ; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot , whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel - house within ; and when we proceed further , and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues , the great principle of light , for ever remains white or colourless in itself , and if operating without medium upon matter , would touch all objects , even tulips and roses , with its own blank tinge -- pondering all this , the palsied universe lies before us a leper ; and like wilful travellers in Lapland , who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes , so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Did you hear that noise , Cabaco ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was the middle - watch ; a fair moonlight ; the seamen were standing in a cordon , extending from one of the fresh - water butts in the waist , to the scuttle - butt near the taffrail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this manner , they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle - butt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Standing , for the most part , on the hallowed precincts of the quarter - deck , they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From hand to hand , the buckets went in the deepest silence , only broken by the occasional flap of a sail , and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Chart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed - down table ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then seating himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At intervals , he would refer to piles of old log - books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While thus employed , the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head , continually rocked with the motion of the ship , and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow , till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts , some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was not this night in particular that , in the solitude of his cabin , Ahab thus pondered over his charts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Almost every night they were brought out ; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced , and others were substituted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For with the charts of all four oceans before him , Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies , with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans , it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not so did it seem to Ahab , who knew the sets of all tides and currents ; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale ' s food ; and , also , calling to mind the regular , ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes ; could arrive at reasonable surmises , almost approaching to certainties , concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale ' s resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring - shoals or the flights of swallows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On this hint , attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* Since the above was written , the statement is happily borne out by an official circular , issued by Lieutenant Maury , of the National Observatory , Washington , April 16th , 1851 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented in the circular ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , when making a passage from one feeding - ground to another , the sperm whales , guided by some infallible instinct -- say , rather , secret intelligence from the Deity -- mostly swim in VEINS , as they are called ; continuing their way along a given ocean - line with such undeviating exactitude , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one tithe of such marvellous precision ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though , in these cases , the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor ' s parallel , and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable , straight wake , yet the arbitrary VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim , generally embraces some few miles in width ( more or less , as the vein is presumed to expand or contract ); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale - ship ' s mast - heads , when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sum is , that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path , migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And hence not only at substantiated times , upon well known separate feeding - grounds , could Ahab hope to encounter his prey ; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could , by his art , so place and time himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not so in the reality , perhaps ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In general , the same remark , only within a less wide limit , applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured , aged sperm whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen , for example , on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean , or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast ; yet it did not follow , that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season , she would infallibly encounter him there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , too , with some other feeding grounds , where he had at times revealed himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all these seemed only his casual stopping - places and ocean - inns , so to speak , not his places of prolonged abode ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And where Ahab ' s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of , allusion has only been made to whatever way - side , antecedent , extra prospects were his , ere a particular set time or place were attained , when all possibilities would become probabilities , and , as Ahab fondly thought , every possibility the next thing to a certainty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase -- the Season - on - the - Line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For there and then , for several consecutive years , Moby Dick had been periodically descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its annual round , loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There it was , too , that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt , he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned , however flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the Season - on - the - Line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards , double Cape Horn , and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet the premature hour of the Pequod ' s sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because , an interval of three hundred and sixty - five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the White Whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding - grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf , or in the Bengal Bay , or China Seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that Monsoons , Pampas , Nor '- Westers , Harmattans , Trades ; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon , might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig - zag world - circle of the Pequod ' s circumnavigating wake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white - bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the peculiar snow - white brow of Moby Dick , and his snow - white hump , could not but be unmistakable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And have I not tallied the whale , Ahab would mutter to himself , as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries -- tallied him , and shall he escape ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His broad fins are bored , and scalloped out like a lost sheep ' s ear !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah , God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He sleeps with clenched hands ; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Often , when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night , which , resuming his own intense thoughts through the day , carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies , and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain , till the very throbbing of his life - spot became insufferable anguish ; and when , as was sometimes the case , these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base , and a chasm seemed opening in him , from which forked flames and lightnings shot up , and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them ; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him , a wild cry would be heard through the ship ; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room , as though escaping from a bed that was on fire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet these , perhaps , instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness , or fright at his own resolve , were but the plainest tokens of its intensity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , at such times , crazy Ahab , the scheming , unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale ; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock , was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul , therefore it must have been that , in Ahab ' s case , yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose ; that purpose , by its own sheer inveteracy of will , forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self - assumed , independent being of its own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nay , could grimly live and burn , while the common vitality to which it was conjoined , fled horror - stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore , the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes , when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room , was for the time but a vacated thing , a formless somnambulistic being , a ray of living light , to be sure , but without an object to colour , and therefore a blankness in itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="God help thee , old man , thy thoughts have created a creature in thee ; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus ; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever ; that vulture the very creature he creates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 45" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Affidavit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book ; and , indeed , as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales , the foregoing chapter , in its earlier part , is as important a one as will be found in this volume ; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon , in order to be adequately understood , and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds , as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I care not to perform this part of my task methodically ; but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items , practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman ; and from these citations , I take it -- the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : I have personally known three instances where a whale , after receiving a harpoon , has effected a complete escape ; and , after an interval ( in one instance of three years ), has been again struck by the same hand , and slain ; when the two irons , both marked by the same private cypher , have been taken from the body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons ; and I think it may have been something more than that ; the man who darted them happening , in the interval , to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa , went ashore there , joined a discovery party , and penetrated far into the interior , where he travelled for a period of nearly two years , often endangered by serpents , savages , tigers , poisonous miasmas , with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels ; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe , brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa ; but to no purpose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This man and this whale again came together , and the one vanquished the other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say I , myself , have known three instances similar to this ; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck ; and , upon the second attack , saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them , afterwards taken from the dead fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the three - year instance , it so fell out that I was in the boat both times , first and last , and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale ' s eye , which I had observed there three years previous ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say three years , but I am pretty sure it was more than that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here are three instances , then , which I personally know the truth of ; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Secondly : It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery , however ignorant the world ashore may be of it , that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be , they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him , and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No : the reason was this : that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini , insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea , without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man , they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street , lest if they pursued the acquaintance further , they might receive a summary thump for their presumption ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity -- Nay , you may call it an ocean - wide renown ; not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death , but he was admitted into all the rights , privileges , and distinctions of a name ; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Was it not so , O Timor Tom !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thou famed leviathan , scarred like an iceberg , who so long did ' st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name , whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="thou Chilian whale , marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In plain prose , here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this is not all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel , after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels , were finally gone in quest of , systematically hunted out , chased and killed by valiant whaling captains , who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view , as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods , Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon , the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I do not know where I can find a better place than just here , to make mention of one or two other things , which to me seem important , as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale , more especially the catastrophe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world , that without some hints touching the plain facts , historical and otherwise , of the fishery , they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable , or still worse and more detestable , a hideous and intolerable allegory ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery , yet they have nothing like a fixed , vivid conception of those perils , and the frequency with which they recur ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One reason perhaps is , that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery , ever finds a public record at home , however transient and immediately forgotten that record ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you suppose that that poor fellow there , who this moment perhaps caught by the whale - line off the coast of New Guinea , is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan -- do you suppose that that poor fellow ' s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to - morrow at your breakfast ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No : because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat ' s crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For God ' s sake , be economical with your lamps and candles !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="not a gallon you burn , but at least one drop of man ' s blood was spilled for it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Secondly : People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two - fold enormousness , they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness ; when , I declare upon my soul , I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses , when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That point is this : The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful , knowing , and judiciously malicious , as with direct aforethought to stave in , utterly destroy , and sink a large ship ; and what is more , the Sperm Whale HAS done it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : In the year 1820 the ship Essex , Captain Pollard , of Nantucket , was cruising in the Pacific Ocean ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One day she saw spouts , lowered her boats , and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere long , several of the whales were wounded ; when , suddenly , a very large whale escaping from the boats , issued from the shoal , and bore directly down upon the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dashing his forehead against her hull , he so stove her in , that in less than &quot; ten minutes &quot; she settled down and fell over ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After the severest exposure , part of the crew reached the land in their boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Being returned home at last , Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship , but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers ; for the second time his ship was utterly lost , and forthwith forswearing the sea , he has never tempted it since ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have seen Owen Chace , who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy ; I have read his plain and faithful narrative ; I have conversed with his son ; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* The following are extracts from Chace ' s narrative : &quot; Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of which , according to their direction , were calculated to do us the most injury , by being made ahead , and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock ; to effect which , the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His aspect was most horrible , and such as indicated resentment and fury ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered , and in which we had struck three of his companions , as if fired with revenge for their sufferings .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again : &quot; At all events , the whole circumstances taken together , all happening before my own eyes , and producing , at the time , impressions in my mind of decided , calculating mischief , on the part of the whale ( many of which impressions I cannot now recall ), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship , during a black night an open boat , when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing ; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest , or dashed upon hidden rocks , with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation , seemed scarcely entitled to a moment ' s thought ; the dismal looking wreck , and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE , wholly engrossed my reflections , until day again made its appearance .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In another place -- p . 45 ,-- he speaks of &quot; THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Secondly : The ship Union , also of Nantucket , was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset , but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter , though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thirdly : Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J ---, then commanding an American sloop - of - war of the first class , happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains , on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu , Sandwich Islands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Conversation turning upon whales , the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He peremptorily denied for example , that any whale could so smite his stout sloop - of - war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Very good ; but there is more coming ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some weeks after , the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale , that begged a few moments ' confidential business with him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That business consisted in fetching the Commodore ' s craft such a thwack , that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I am not superstitious , but I consider the Commodore ' s interview with that whale as providential ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I tell you , the sperm whale will stand no nonsense ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I will now refer you to Langsdorff ' s Voyages for a little circumstance in point , peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Langsdorff , you must know by the way , was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern ' s famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter :" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail , and the next day we were out in the open sea , on our way to Ochotsh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The weather was very clear and fine , but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For some days we had very little wind ; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An uncommon large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as this gigantic creature , setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of the water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The masts reeled , and the sails fell altogether , while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck , concluding that we had struck upon some rock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain D ' Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock , but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the Captain D ' Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question , is a New Englander , who , after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea - captain , this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have the honour of being a nephew of his ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He substantiates every word ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship , however , was by no means a large one : a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast , and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In that up and down manly book of old - fashioned adventure , so full , too , of honest wonders -- the voyage of Lionel Wafer , one of ancient Dampier ' s old chums -- I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff , that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example , if such be needed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lionel , it seems , was on his way to &quot; John Ferdinando ,&quot; as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In our way thither ,&quot; he says , &quot; about four o ' clock in the morning , when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America , our ship felt a terrible shock , which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think ; but every one began to prepare for death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , indeed , the shock was so sudden and violent , that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amazement was a little over , we cast the lead , and sounded , but found no ground ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="...." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages , and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Davis , who lay with his head on a gun , was thrown out of his cabin !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake , and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake , somewhere about that time , did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I should not much wonder if , in the darkness of that early hour of the morning , the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I might proceed with several more examples , one way or another known to me , of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In more than one instance , he has been known , not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships , but to pursue the ship itself , and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head ; and , as for his strength , let me say , that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have , in a calm , been transferred to the ship , and secured there ; the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a horse walks off with a cart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again , it is very often observed that , if the sperm whale , once struck , is allowed time to rally , he then acts , not so often with blind rage , as with wilful , deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers ; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character , that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth , and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration ; a remarkable and most significant one , by which you will not fail to see , that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day , but that these marvels ( like all marvels ) are mere repetitions of the ages ; so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon -- Verily there is nothing new under the sun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius , a Christian magistrate of Constantinople , in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As many know , he wrote the history of his own times , a work every way of uncommon value ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the best authorities , he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian , except in some one or two particulars , not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , in this history of his , Procopius mentions that , during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople , a great sea - monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis , or Sea of Marmora , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is there any reason it should be ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of what precise species this sea - monster was , is not mentioned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as he destroyed ships , as well as for other reasons , he must have been a whale ; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I will tell you why ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even now I am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present constitution of things , a place for his habitual gregarious resort ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But further investigations have recently proved to me , that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I am told , on good authority , that on the Barbary coast , a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles , hence a sperm whale could , by the same route , pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the Propontis , as far as I can learn , none of that peculiar substance called BRIT is to be found , the aliment of the right whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale -- squid or cuttle - fish -- lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If , then , you properly put these statements together , and reason upon them a bit , you will clearly perceive that , according to all human reasoning , Procopius ' s sea - monster , that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor , must in all probability have been a sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 46" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Surmises ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though , consumed with the hot fire of his purpose , Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick ; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman ' s ways , altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or at least if this were otherwise , there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It would be refining too much , perhaps , even considering his monomania , to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales , and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable , there were still additional considerations which , though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion , yet were by no means incapable of swaying him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools ; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon , men are most apt to get out of order ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the purely spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starbuck ' s body and Starbuck ' s coerced will were Ahab ' s , so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck ' s brain ; still he knew that for all this the chief mate , in his soul , abhorred his captain ' s quest , and could he , would joyfully disintegrate himself from it , or even frustrate it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain ' s leadership , unless some ordinary , prudential , circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not only that , but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that , for the present , the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background ( for few men ' s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action ); that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable -- they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness -- and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however promissory of life and passion in the end , it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations ; but such times are evanescent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man , thought Ahab , is sordidness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew , and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight - errantism in them , still , while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick , they must also have food for their more common , daily appetites ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre , without committing burglaries , picking pockets , and gaining other pious perquisites by the way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object -- that final and romantic object , too many would have turned from in disgust ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I will not strip these men , thought Ahab , of all hopes of cash -- aye , cash ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They may scorn cash now ; but let some months go by , and no perspective promise of it to them , and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them , this same cash would soon cashier Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Having impulsively , it is probable , and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod ' s voyage , Ahab was now entirely conscious that , in so doing , he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation ; and with perfect impunity , both moral and legal , his crew if so disposed , and to that end competent , could refuse all further obedience to him , and even violently wrest from him the command ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation , and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground , Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand , backed by a heedful , closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For all these reasons then , and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here , Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural , nominal purpose of the Pequod ' s voyage ; observe all customary usages ; and not only that , but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be all this as it may , his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast - heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look - out , and not omit reporting even a porpoise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This vigilance was not long without reward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 47" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Mat - Maker ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a cloudy , sultry afternoon ; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks , or vacantly gazing over into the lead - coloured waters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword - mat , for an additional lashing to our boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene , and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air , that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was the attendant or page of Queequeg , while busy at the mat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp , using my own hand for the shuttle , and as Queequeg , standing sideways , ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads , and idly looking off upon the water , carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn : I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea , only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword , that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time , and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single , ever returning , unchanging vibration , and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This warp seemed necessity ; and here , thought I , with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , Queequeg ' s impulsive , indifferent sword , sometimes hitting the woof slantingly , or crookedly , or strongly , or weakly , as the case might be ; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric ; this savage ' s sword , thought I , which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof ; this easy , indifferent sword must be chance -- aye , chance , free will , and necessity -- nowise incompatible -- all interweavingly working together ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The straight warp of necessity , not to be swerved from its ultimate course -- its every alternating vibration , indeed , only tending to that ; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads ; and chance , though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its motions directed by free will , though thus prescribed to by both , chance by turns rules either , and has the last featuring blow at events ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange , long drawn , and musically wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will dropped from my hand , and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="High aloft in the cross - trees was that mad Gay - Header , Tashtego ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His body was reaching eagerly forward , his hand stretched out like a wand , and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas , from hundreds of whalemen ' s look - outs perched as high in the air ; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air , so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon , you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate , and by those wild cries announcing their coming ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There she blows !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="she blows !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="she blows !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Where - away ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; On the lee - beam , about two miles off !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a school of them !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Instantly all was commotion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks , with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There go flukes !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was now the cry from Tashtego ; and the whales disappeared ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Quick , steward !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Time !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="time !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dough - Boy hurried below , glanced at the watch , and reported the exact minute to Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship was now kept away from the wind , and she went gently rolling before it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward , we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when , sounding with his head in one direction , he nevertheless , while concealed beneath the surface , mills round , and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter -- this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action ; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed , or indeed knew at all of our vicinity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One of the men selected for shipkeepers -- that is , those not appointed to the boats , by this time relieved the Indian at the main - mast head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down ; the line tubs were fixed in their places ; the cranes were thrust out ; the mainyard was backed , and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail , while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So look the long line of man - of - war ' s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy ' s ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a start all glared at dark Ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 48" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The First Lowering ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats , though technically called the captain ' s , on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel - like lips ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Less swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , tiger - yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas ;-- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil , their lord , whose counting - room they suppose to be elsewhere ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While yet the wondering ship ' s company were gazing upon these strangers , Ahab cried out to the white - turbaned old man at their head , &quot; All ready there , Fedallah ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ready ,&quot; was the half - hissed reply ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lower away then ; d ' ye hear ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shouting across the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lower away there , I say .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow , the three boats dropped into the sea ; while , with a dexterous , off - handed daring , unknown in any other vocation , the sailors , goat - like , leaped down the rolling ship ' s side into the tossed boats below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship ' s lee , when a fourth keel , coming from the windward side , pulled round under the stern , and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab , who , standing erect in the stern , loudly hailed Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask , to spread themselves widely , so as to cover a large expanse of water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew , the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Ahab ?--&quot; said Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Spread yourselves ,&quot; cried Ahab ; &quot; give way , all four boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou , Flask , pull out more to leeward !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye , sir ,&quot; cheerily cried little King - Post , sweeping round his great steering oar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lay back !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="addressing his crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There !-- there !-- there again !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There she blows right ahead , boys !-- lay back !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Never heed yonder yellow boys , Archy .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , I don ' t mind ' em , sir ,&quot; said Archy ; &quot; I knew it all before now ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Flask .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pull , pull , my fine hearts - alive ; pull , my children ; pull , my little ones ,&quot; drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew , some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="What is it you stare at ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stop snoring , ye sleepers , and pull ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pull , will ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="pull , can ' t ye ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger - cakes don ' t ye pull ?-- pull and break something !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="pull , and start your eyes out !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle ; &quot; every mother ' s son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Start her , marling - spikes !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb ' s exordium to his crew is given here at large , because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general , and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not at all ; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He would say the most terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury , and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun , that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life , and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself , so loungingly managed his steering - oar , and so broadly gaped -- open - mouthed at times -- that the mere sight of such a yawning commander , by sheer force of contrast , acted like a charm upon the crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then again , Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists , whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous , as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In obedience to a sign from Ahab , Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb ' s bow ; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other , Stubb hailed the mate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mr . Starbuck !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="larboard boat there , ahoy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a word with ye , sir , if ye please !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Halloa !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="returned Starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew ; his face set like a flint from Stubb ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What think ye of those yellow boys , sir !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( Strong , strong , boys !)&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again : &quot; A sad business , Mr . Stubb !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( seethe her , seethe her , my lads !)" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="but never mind , Mr . Stubb , all for the best ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let all your crew pull strong , come what will ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( Spring , my men , spring !)" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s hogsheads of sperm ahead , Mr . Stubb , and that ' s what ye came for ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( Pull , my boys !)" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sperm , sperm ' s the play !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in hand .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye , I thought as much ,&quot; soliloquized Stubb , when the boats diverged , &quot; as soon as I clapt eye on ' em , I thought so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , and that ' s what he went into the after hold for , so often , as Dough - Boy long suspected ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were hidden down there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The White Whale ' s at the bottom of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , well , so be it !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can ' t be helped !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All right !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Give way , men !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ain ' t the White Whale to - day !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Give way !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck , this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship ' s company ; but Archy ' s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them , though indeed not credited then , this had in some small measure prepared them for the event ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It took off the extreme edge of their wonder ; and so what with all this and Stubb ' s confident way of accounting for their appearance , they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings ; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab ' s precise agency in the matter from the beginning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For me , I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn , as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , Ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having sided the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip - hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength , which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for Fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat Ahab , with one arm , like a fencer ' s , thrown half backward into the air , as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed , while the boat ' s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue , thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement , though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Every man look out along his oars !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou , Queequeg , stand up !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow , the savage stood erect there , and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale , Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft , and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not very far distant Flask ' s boat was also lying breathlessly still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead , a stout sort of post rooted in the keel , and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is used for catching turns with the whale line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man ' s hand , and standing upon such a base as that , Flask seemed perched at the mast - head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But little King - Post was small and short , and at the same time little King - Post was full of a large and tall ambition , so that this loggerhead stand - point of his did by no means satisfy King - Post ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I can ' t see three seas off ; tip us up an oar there , and let me on to that .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this , Daggoo , with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way , swiftly slid aft , and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Good a mast - head as any , sir ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Will you mount ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; That I will , and thank ye very much , my fine fellow ; only I wish you fifty feet taller .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat , the gigantic negro , stooping a little , presented his flat palm to Flask ' s foot , and then putting Flask ' s hand on his hearse - plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss , with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And here was Flask now standing , Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross - running seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself , under such circumstances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On his broad back , flaxen - haired Flask seemed a snow - flake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The bearer looked nobler than the rider ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though truly vivacious , tumultuous , ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience ; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro ' s lordly chest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth , but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile Stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such far - gazing solicitudes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whales might have made one of their regular soundings , not a temporary dive from mere fright ; and if that were the case , Stubb , as his wont in such cases , it seems , was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He withdrew it from his hatband , where he always wore it aslant like a feather ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He loaded it , and rammed home the loading with his thumb - end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand , when Tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry , &quot; Down , down all , and give way !-- there they are !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To a landsman , no whale , nor any sign of a herring , would have been visible at that moment ; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water , and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it , and suffusingly blowing off to leeward , like the confused scud from white rolling billows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled , as it were , like the air over intensely heated plates of iron ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling , and partially beneath a thin layer of water , also , the whales were swimming ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seen in advance of all the other indications , the puffs of vapour they spouted , seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it bade fair to outstrip them ; it flew on and on , as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pull , pull , my good boys ,&quot; said Starbuck , in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men ; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow , almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He did not say much to his crew , though , nor did his crew say anything to him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers , now harsh with command , now soft with entreaty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How different the loud little King - Post ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sing out and say something , my hearties ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Roar and pull , my thunderbolts !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Beach me , beach me on their black backs , boys ; only do that for me , and I ' ll sign over to you my Martha ' s Vineyard plantation , boys ; including wife and children , boys ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lay me on -- lay me on !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="O Lord , Lord !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="but I shall go stark , staring mad !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="see that white water !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so shouting , he pulled his hat from his head , and stamped up and down on it ; then picking it up , flirted it far off upon the sea ; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat ' s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look at that chap now ,&quot; philosophically drawled Stubb , who , with his unlighted short pipe , mechanically retained between his teeth , at a short distance , followed after --&quot; He ' s got fits , that Flask has ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fits ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="yes , give him fits -- that ' s the very word -- pitch fits into ' em ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Merrily , merrily , hearts - alive ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pudding for supper , you know ;-- merry ' s the word ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pull , babes -- pull , sucklings -- pull , all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what the devil are you hurrying about ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Softly , softly , and steadily , my men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Crack all your backbones , and bite your knives in two -- that ' s all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Take it easy -- why don ' t ye take it easy , I say , and burst all your livers and lungs !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger - yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words , when , with tornado brow , and eyes of red murder , and foam - glued lips , Ahab leaped after his prey ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , all the boats tore on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The repeated specific allusions of Flask to &quot; that whale ,&quot; as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat ' s bow with its tail -- these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life - like , that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes , and ram a skewer through their necks ; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears , and no limbs but arms , in these critical moments ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The vast swells of the omnipotent sea ; the surging , hollow roar they made , as they rolled along the eight gunwales , like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling - green ; the brief suspended agony of the boat , as it would tip for an instant on the knife - like edge of the sharper waves , that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two ; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows ; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill ; the headlong , sled - like slide down its other side ;-- all these , with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers , and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen , with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails , like a wild hen after her screaming brood ;-- all this was thrilling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not the raw recruit , marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle ; not the dead man ' s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world ;-- neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does , who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed , churned circle of the hunted sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible , owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud - shadows flung upon the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The jets of vapour no longer blended , but tilted everywhere to right and left ; the whales seemed separating their wakes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The boats were pulled more apart ; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row - locks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Give way , men ,&quot; whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; &quot; there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s white water again !-- close to !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Spring !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon after , two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast ; but hardly were they overheard , when with a lightning - like hurtling whisper Starbuck said : &quot; Stand up !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and Queequeg , harpoon in hand , sprang to his feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead , yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat , they knew that the imminent instant had come ; they heard , too , an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist , the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; That ' s his hump ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="THERE , THERE , give it to him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="whispered Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of Queequeg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern , while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge ; the sail collapsed and exploded ; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by ; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter - skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Squall , whale , and harpoon had all blended together ; and the whale , merely grazed by the iron , escaped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which , unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life - preservers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to Queequeg as the standard - bearer of this forlorn hope ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We all heard a faint creaking , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat , as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship ' s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract ; and then the vast hull rolled over it , and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again we swam for it , were dashed against it by the seas , and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship had given us up , but was still cruising , if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing ,-- an oar or a lance pole ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 49" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Hyena ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody ' s expense but his own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He bolts down all events , all creeds , and beliefs , and persuasions , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as for small difficulties and worryings , prospects of sudden disaster , peril of life and limb ; all these , and death itself , seem to him only sly , good - natured hits , and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of , comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation ; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness , so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous , now seems but a part of the general joke ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial , desperado philosophy ; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod , and the great White Whale its object ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg ,&quot; said I , when they had dragged me , the last man , to the deck , and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water ; &quot; Queequeg , my fine friend , does this sort of thing often happen ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Without much emotion , though soaked through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mr . Stubb ,&quot; said I , turning to that worthy , who , buttoned up in his oil - jacket , was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain ; &quot; Mr . Stubb , I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met , our chief mate , Mr . Starbuck , is by far the most careful and prudent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I suppose then , that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman ' s discretion ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Certain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mr . Flask ,&quot; said I , turning to little King - Post , who was standing close by ; &quot; you are experienced in these things , and I am not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery , Mr . Flask , for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back - foremost into death ' s jaws ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Can ' t you twist that smaller ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes , that ' s the law ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I should like to see a boat ' s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha , ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the whale would give them squint for squint , mind that !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here then , from three impartial witnesses , I had a deliberate statement of the entire case ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Considering , therefore , that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep , were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat -- oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck ' s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that Starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck ' s boat ; and finally considering in what a devil ' s chase I was implicated , touching the White Whale : taking all things together , I say , I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Who would have thought it , Flask !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb ; &quot; if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug - hole with my timber toe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he ' s a wonderful old man !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I don ' t think it so strange , after all , on that account ,&quot; said Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; If his leg were off at the hip , now , it would be a different thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That would disable him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I don ' t know that , my little man ; I never yet saw him kneel .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Among whale - wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So Tamerlane ' s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes , whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties ; that every individual moment , indeed , then comprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale - boat in the hunt ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As a general thing , the joint - owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -- above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat ' s crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore he had not solicited a boat ' s crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Until Cabaco ' s published discovery , the sailors had little foreseen it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service ; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole - pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers , which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow : when all this was observed in him , and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat , as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board , or clumsy cleat , as it is sometimes called , the horizontal piece in the boat ' s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale ; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi - circular depression in the cleat , and with the carpenter ' s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there ; all these things , I say , had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick ; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat ' s crew being assigned to that boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , with the subordinate phantoms , what wonder remained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon wane ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash - holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , whaleboats , canoes , blown - off Japanese junks , and what not ; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But be all this as it may , certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that hair - turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whence he came in a mannerly world like this , by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab ' s peculiar fortunes ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a half - hinted influence ; Heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was such a creature as civilized , domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams , and that but dimly ; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities , especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent -- those insulated , immemorial , unalterable countries , which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth ' s primal generations , when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection , and all men his descendants , unknowing whence he came , eyed each other as real phantoms , and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end ; when though , according to Genesis , the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men , the devils also , add the uncanonical Rabbins , indulged in mundane amours ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 51" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Spirit - Spout ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Days , weeks passed , and under easy sail , the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising - grounds ; that off the Azores ; off the Cape de Verdes ; on the Plate ( so called ), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata ; and the Carrol Ground , an unstaked , watery locality , southerly from St . Helena ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver ; and , by their soft , suffusing seethings , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a solitude ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fedallah first descried this jet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main - mast head , and stand a look - out there , with the same precision as if it had been day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You may think with what emotions , then , the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours ; his turban and the moon , companions in one sky ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when , after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound ; when , after all this silence , his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery , moon - lit jet , every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging , and hailed the mortal crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There she blows !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had the trump of judgment blown , they could not have quivered more ; yet still they felt no terror ; rather pleasure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For though it was a most unwonted hour , yet so impressive was the cry , and so deliriously exciting , that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Walking the deck with quick , side - lunging strides , Ahab commanded the t ' gallant sails and royals to be set , and every stunsail spread ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The best man in the ship must take the helm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , with every mast - head manned , the piled - up craft rolled down before the wind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The strange , upheaving , lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails , made the buoyant , hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while still she rushed along , as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her -- one to mount direct to heaven , the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And had you watched Ahab ' s face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck , every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin - tap ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On life and death this old man walked ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though the ship so swiftly sped , and though from every eye , like arrows , the eager glances shot , yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This midnight - spout had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="at the same silent hour , it was again announced : again it was descried by all ; but upon making sail to overtake it , once more it disappeared as if it had never been ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight , or starlight , as the case might be ; disappearing again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van , this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the preternaturalness , as it seemed , which in many things invested the Pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes , that unnearable spout was cast by one self - same whale ; and that whale , Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn - like prow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , at last , when turning to the eastward , the Cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory - tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast , and gored the dark waves in her madness , till , like showers of silver chips , the foam - flakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Close to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea - ravens ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And every morning , perched on our stays , rows of these birds were seen ; and spite of our hootings , for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp , as though they deemed our ship some drifting , uninhabited craft ; a thing appointed to desolation , and therefore fit roosting - place for their homeless selves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And heaved and heaved , still unrestingly heaved the black sea , as if its vast tides were a conscience ; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Cape of Good Hope , do they call ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Rather Cape Tormentoto , as called of yore ; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us , we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea , where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish , seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store , or beat that black air without any horizon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But calm , snow - white , and unvarying ; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="During all this blackness of the elements , Ahab , though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck , manifested the gloomiest reserve ; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole , and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud , Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward , while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows , stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against the leaping waves , each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail , in which he swung as in a loosened belt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Few or no words were spoken ; and the silent ship , as if manned by painted sailors in wax , day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed ; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines ; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Never could Starbuck forget the old man ' s aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor - screwed chair ; the rain and half - melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell - tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* The cabin - compass is called the tell - tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Terrible old man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thought Starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 52" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Albatross ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="South - eastward from the Cape , off the distant Crozetts , a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the Goney ( Albatross ) by name ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the fore - mast - head , I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries -- a whaler at sea , and long absent from home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar - frost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only her lower sails were set ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A wild sight it was to see her long - bearded look - outs at those three mast - heads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast , they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast - heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those forlorn - looking fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look - outs , while the quarter - deck hail was being heard from below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ship ahoy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Have ye seen the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale ' s name to another ship , Ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed --&quot; Ahoy there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This is the Pequod , bound round the world !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and this time three years , if I am not at home , tell them to address them to --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger ' s flanks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Swim away from me , do ye ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="murmured Ahab , gazing over into the water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There seemed but little in the words , but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But turning to the steersman , who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway , he cried out in his old lion voice ,--&quot; Up helm !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Keep her off round the world !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Round the world !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings ; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started , where those that we left behind secure , were all the time before us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Were this world an endless plain , and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances , and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon , then there were promise in the voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 53" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Gam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , as it eventually turned out , he cared not to consort , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all this might remain inadequately estimated , were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling - vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas , and especially on a common cruising - ground ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State , or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England ; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds , these twain , for the life of them , cannot well avoid a mutual salutation ; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news ; and , perhaps , sitting down for a while and resting in concert : then , how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea , two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth -- off lone Fanning ' s Island , or the far away King ' s Mills ; how much more natural , I say , that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails , but come into still closer , more friendly and sociable contact ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And especially would this seem to be a matter of course , in the case of vessels owned in one seaport , and whose captains , officers , and not a few of the men are personally known to each other ; and consequently , have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the long absent ship , the outward - bounder , perhaps , has letters on board ; at any rate , she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb - worn files ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And in return for that courtesy , the outward - bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising - ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other ' s track on the cruising - ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors , but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with Americans and English ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though , to be sure , from the small number of English whalers , such meetings do not very often occur , and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them ; for your Englishman is rather reserved , and your Yankee , he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers ; regarding the long , lean Nantucketer , with his nondescript provincialisms , as a sort of sea - peasant ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist , it would be hard to say , seeing that the Yankees in one day , collectively , kill more whales than all the English , collectively , in ten years ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale - hunters , which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart ; probably , because he knows that he has a few foibles himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , then , we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea , the whalers have most reason to be sociable -- and they are so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other ' s wake in the mid - Atlantic , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition , mutually cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of dandies in Broadway ; and all the time indulging , perhaps , in finical criticism upon each other ' s rig ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for Men - of - War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right - down hearty good - will and brotherly love about it at all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As touching Slave - ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as for Pirates , when they chance to cross each other ' s cross - bones , the first hail is --&quot; How many skulls ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- the same way that whalers hail --&quot; How many barrels ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal villains on both sides , and don ' t like to see overmuch of each other ' s villanous likenesses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free - and - easy whaler !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She has a &quot; GAM ,&quot; a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about &quot; spouters &quot; and &quot; blubber - boilers ,&quot; and such like pretty exclamations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why it is that all Merchant - seamen , and also all Pirates and Man - of - War ' s men , and Slave - ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale - ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hence , I conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what is a GAM ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You might wear out your index - finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dr . Johnson never attained to that erudition ; Noah Webster ' s ark does not hold it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Certainly , it needs a definition , and should be incorporated into the Lexicon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With that view , let me learnedly define it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="GAM ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="NOUN -- A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO ( OR MORE ) WHALESHIPS , GENERALLY ON A CRUISING - GROUND ; WHEN , AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS , THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY BOATS ' CREWS ; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING , FOR THE TIME , ON BOARD OF ONE SHIP , AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a pirate , man - of - war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner ' s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the whale - boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="High times indeed , if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as for a tiller , the whale - boat never admits of any such effeminacy ; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat ' s crew must leave the ship , and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number , that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion , and the captain , having no place to sit in , is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships , this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is this any very easy matter ; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back , the after - oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is thus completely wedged before and behind , and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs ; but a sudden , violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him , because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Merely make a spread angle of two poles , and you cannot stand them up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , again , it would never do in plain sight of the world ' s riveted eyes , it would never do , I say , for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands ; indeed , as token of his entire , buoyant self - command , he generally carries his hands in his trowsers ' pockets ; but perhaps being generally very large , heavy hands , he carries them there for ballast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless there have occurred instances , well authenticated ones too , where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two , in a sudden squall say -- to seize hold of the nearest oarsman ' s hair , and hold on there like grim death ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Town - Ho ' s Story ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN )" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Cape of Good Hope , and all the watery region round about there , is much like some noted four corners of a great highway , where you meet more travellers than in any other part ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward - bound whaleman , the Town - Ho ,* was encountered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town - Ho ' s story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This latter circumstance , with its own particular accompaniments , forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated , never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town - Ho himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they governed in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod ' s main - mast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* The ancient whale - cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast - head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For my humor ' s sake , I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima , to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends , one saint ' s eve , smoking upon the thick - gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of those fine cavaliers , the young Dons , Pedro and Sebastian , were on the closer terms with me ; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put , and which are duly answered at the time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you , gentlemen , the Town - Ho , Sperm Whaler of Nantucket , was cruising in your Pacific here , not very many days ' sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She was somewhere to the northward of the Line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One morning upon handling the pumps , according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They supposed a sword - fish had stabbed her , gentlemen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the captain , having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very averse to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by , and not only was the leak yet undiscovered , but it sensibly increased ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So much so , that now taking some alarm , the captain , making all sail , stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands , there to have his hull hove out and repaired ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Though no small passage was before her , yet , if the commonest chance favoured , he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way , because his pumps were of the best , and being periodically relieved at them , those six - and - thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free ; never mind if the leak should double on her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes , the Town - Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney , the mate , a Vineyarder , and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt , a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Lakeman !-- Buffalo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pray , what is a Lakeman , and where is Buffalo ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Don Sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie , Don ; but -- I crave your courtesy -- may be , you shall soon hear further of all that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , gentlemen , in square - sail brigs and three - masted ships , well - nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla ; this Lakeman , in the land - locked heart of our America , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For in their interflowing aggregate , those grand fresh - water seas of ours ,-- Erie , and Ontario , and Huron , and Superior , and Michigan ,-- possess an ocean - like expansiveness , with many of the ocean ' s noblest traits ; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the Polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the Atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat - like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland , as well as Winnebago villages ; they float alike the full - rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the State , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , gentlemen , though an inlander , Steelkilt was wild - ocean born , and wild - ocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And for Radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach , to nurse at his maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific ; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman , fresh from the latitudes of buck - horn handled bowie - knives ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good - hearted traits ; and this Lakeman , a mariner , who though a sort of devil indeed , might yet by inflexible firmness , only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave ' s right ; thus treated , this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At all events , he had proved so thus far ; but Radney was doomed and made mad , and Steelkilt -- but , gentlemen , you shall hear ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the Town - Ho ' s leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump - handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ; that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really landless latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Much this way had it been with the Town - Ho ; so when her leak was found gaining once more , there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company ; especially by Radney the mate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted , sheeted home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship , some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So when they were working that evening at the pumps , there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them , as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water ; clear as any mountain spring , gentlemen -- that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck , and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper - holes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours -- watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his fellow - men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood , straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern ' s tower , and make a little heap of dust of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman , and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy ' s snorting charger ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne , had he been born son to Charlemagne ' s father ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Radney , the mate , was ugly as a mule ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He did not love Steelkilt , and Steelkilt knew it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Aye , aye , my merry lads , it ' s a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let ' s have a taste ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the Lord , it ' s worth bottling !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I tell ye what , men , old Rad ' s investment must go for it !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The fact is , boys , that sword - fish only began the job ; he ' s come back again with a gang of ship - carpenters , saw - fish , and file - fish , and what not ; and the whole posse of ' em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom ; making improvements , I suppose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If old Rad were here now , I ' d tell him to jump overboard and scatter ' em ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They ' re playing the devil with his estate , I can tell him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he ' s a simple old soul ,-- Rad , and a beauty too ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Boys , they say the rest of his property is invested in looking - glasses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I wonder if he ' d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Damn your eyes !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what ' s that pump stopping for ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="roared Radney , pretending not to have heard the sailors ' talk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Thunder away at it !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Aye , aye , sir ,' said Steelkilt , merry as a cricket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Lively , boys , lively , now !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire - engines ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life ' s utmost energies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Quitting the pump at last , with the rest of his band , the Lakeman went forward all panting , and sat himself down on the windlass ; his face fiery red , his eyes bloodshot , and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now what cozening fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state , I know not ; but so it happened ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Intolerably striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship ' s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea - usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , it was the stronger men in the Town - Ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But there was more than this : the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt , as though Radney had spat in his face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Any man who has gone sailor in a whale - ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate ' s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder - casks heaped up in him and the slow - match silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being -- a repugnance most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when aggrieved -- this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over Steelkilt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Therefore , in his ordinary tone , only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in , he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business , and he would not do it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And then , without at all alluding to the shovel , he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers ; who , not being billeted at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To this , Radney replied with an oath , in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman , with an uplifted cooper ' s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps , for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate ; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him , without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat , till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face , furiously commanding him to do his bidding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Steelkilt rose , and slowly retreating round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing , however , that his forbearance had not the slightest effect , by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man ; but it was to no purpose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor , the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer :" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Mr ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Radney , I will not obey you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Take that hammer away , or look to yourself .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him , where the Lakeman stood fixed , now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth ; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch ; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance , Steelkilt , clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back , told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he ( Steelkilt ) would murder him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , gentlemen , the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Immediately the hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were both Canallers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Canallers !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Don Pedro ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' We have seen many whale - ships in our harbours , but never heard of your Canallers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pardon : who and what are they ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Canallers , Don , are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You must have heard of it .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Nay , Senor ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most lazy , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous North .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Aye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well then , Don , refill my cup ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Your chicha ' s very fine ; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are ; for such information may throw side - light upon my story .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; For three hundred and sixty miles , gentlemen , through the entire breadth of the state of New York ; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages ; through long , dismal , uninhabited swamps , and affluent , cultivated fields , unrivalled for fertility ; by billiard - room and bar - room ; through the holy - of - holies of great forests ; on Roman arches over Indian rivers ; through sun and shade ; by happy hearts or broken ; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties ; and especially , by rows of snow - white chapels , whose spires stand almost like milestones , flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s your true Ashantee , gentlemen ; there howl your pagans ; where you ever find them , next door to you ; under the long - flung shadow , and the snug patronising lee of churches ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For by some curious fatality , as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice , so sinners , gentlemen , most abound in holiest vicinities ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Is that a friar passing ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Don Pedro , looking downwards into the crowded plazza , with humorous concern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Well for our northern friend , Dame Isabella ' s Inquisition wanes in Lima ,' laughed Don Sebastian ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Proceed , Senor .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' A moment !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pardon !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried another of the company ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' In the name of all us Limeese , I but desire to express to you , sir sailor , that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="do not bow and look surprised ; you know the proverb all along this coast --&quot; Corrupt as Lima .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It but bears out your saying , too ; churches more plentiful than billiard - tables , and for ever open -- and &quot; Corrupt as Lima .&quot;" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Mark !-- St ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dominic , purge it !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Your cup !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thanks : here I refill ; now , you pour out again .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Freely depicted in his own vocation , gentlemen , the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero , so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like Mark Antony , for days and days along his green - turfed , flowery Nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red - cheeked Cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ashore , all this effeminacy is dashed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily - ribboned hat betoken his grand features ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats ; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Once a vagabond on his own canal , I have received good turns from one of these Canallers ; I thank him heartily ; would fain be not ungrateful ; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence , that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait , as to plunder a wealthy one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In sum , gentlemen , what the wildness of this canal life is , is emphatically evinced by this ; that our wild whale - fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates , and that scarce any race of mankind , except Sydney men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter , that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line , the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn - field , and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' I see !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I see !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro , spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' No need to travel !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The world ' s one Lima ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I had thought , now , that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the hills .-- But the story .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I left off , gentlemen , where the Lakeman shook the backstay ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hardly had he done so , when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers , who all crowded him to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets , the two Canallers rushed into the uproar , and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt , and a twisted turmoil ensued ; while standing out of harm ' s way , the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale - pike , calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel , and smoke him along to the quarter - deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At intervals , he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion , and prying into the heart of it with his pike , sought to prick out the object of his resentment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass , these sea - Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Come out of that , ye pirates !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="roared the captain , now menacing them with a pistol in each hand , just brought to him by the steward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Come out of that , ye cut - throats !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Steelkilt leaped on the barricade , and striding up and down there , defied the worst the pistols could do ; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his ( Steelkilt ' s ) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true , the captain a little desisted , but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Will you promise not to touch us , if we do ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="demanded their ringleader ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Turn to !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="turn to !-- I make no promise ;-- to your duty !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you want to sink the ship , by knocking off at a time like this ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Turn to !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and he once more raised a pistol ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Sink the ship ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Steelkilt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Aye , let her sink ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not a man of us turns to , unless you swear not to raise a rope - yarn against us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What say ye , men ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="turning to his comrades ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A fierce cheer was their response ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade , all the while keeping his eye on the Captain , and jerking out such sentences as these :--' It ' s not our fault ; we didn ' t want it ; I told him to take his hammer away ; it was boy ' s business ; he might have known me before this ; I told him not to prick the buffalo ; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ; ain ' t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there , men ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="look to those handspikes , my hearties ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain , by God , look to yourself ; say the word ; don ' t be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; treat us decently , and we ' re your men ; but we won ' t be flogged .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Turn to !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I make no promises , turn to , I say !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Look ye , now ,' cried the Lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , ' there are a few of us here ( and I am one of them ) who have shipped for the cruise , d ' ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down ; so we don ' t want a row ; it ' s not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we won ' t be flogged .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Turn to !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="roared the Captain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Steelkilt glanced round him a moment , and then said :--' I tell you what it is now , Captain , rather than kill ye , and be hung for such a shabby rascal , we won ' t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us ; but till you say the word about not flogging us , we don ' t do a hand ' s turn .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Down into the forecastle then , down with ye , I ' ll keep ye there till ye ' re sick of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Down ye go .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Shall we ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the ringleader to his men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Most of them were against it ; but at length , in obedience to Steelkilt , they preceded him down into their dark den , growlingly disappearing , like bears into a cave ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; As the Lakeman ' s bare head was just level with the planks , the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade , and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle , planted their group of hands upon it , and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then opening the slide a little , the Captain whispered something down the crack , closed it , and turned the key upon them -- ten in number -- leaving on deck some twenty or more , who thus far had remained neutral ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; All night a wide - awake watch was kept by all the officers , forward and aft , especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway ; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge , after breaking through the bulkhead below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the hours of darkness passed in peace ; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps , whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; At sunrise the Captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they refused ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Water was then lowered down to them , and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it ; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it , the Captain returned to the quarter - deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Twice every day for three days this was repeated ; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling , and then a scuffling was heard , as the customary summons was delivered ; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle , saying they were ready to turn to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The fetid closeness of the air , and a famishing diet , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution , had constrained them to surrender at discretion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Emboldened by this , the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only three were left ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Better turn to , now ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said the Captain with a heartless jeer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Shut us up again , will ye !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Steelkilt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Oh certainly ,' the Captain , and the key clicked ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It was at this point , gentlemen , that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates , and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him , and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair ; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers , thus far apparently of one mind with him , to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison ; and armed with their keen mincing knives ( long , crescentic , heavy implements with a handle at each end ) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail ; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible , seize the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For himself , he would do this , he said , whether they joined him or not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That was the last night he should spend in that den ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two ; they swore they were ready for that , or for any other mad thing , for anything in short but a surrender ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what was more , they each insisted upon being the first man on deck , when the time to make the rush should come ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to this their leader as fiercely objected , reserving that priority for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And here , gentlemen , the foul play of these miscreants must come out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader , each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted , it would seem , upon the same piece of treachery , namely : to be foremost in breaking out , in order to be the first of the three , though the last of the ten , to surrender ; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle chemistry of villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and gagged him with cords ; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thinking murder at hand , and smelling in the dark for the blood , he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a few minutes the scuttle was opened , and , bound hand and foot , the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies , who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all these were collared , and dragged along the deck like dead cattle ; and , side by side , were seized up into the mizzen rigging , like three quarters of meat , and there they hung till morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Damn ye ,' cried the Captain , pacing to and fro before them , ' the vultures would not touch ye , ye villains !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; At sunrise he summoned all hands ; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny , he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round -- thought , upon the whole , he would do so -- he ought to -- justice demanded it ; but for the present , considering their timely surrender , he would let them go with a reprimand , which he accordingly administered in the vernacular ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' But as for you , ye carrion rogues ,' turning to the three men in the rigging --' for you , I mean to mince ye up for the try - pots ;' and , seizing a rope , he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors , till they yelled no more , but lifelessly hung their heads sideways , as the two crucified thieves are drawn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' My wrist is sprained with ye !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he cried , at last ; ' but there is still rope enough left for you , my fine bantam , that wouldn ' t give up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Take that gag from his mouth , and let us hear what he can say for himself .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws , and then painfully twisting round his head , said in a sort of hiss , ' What I say is this -- and mind it well -- if you flog me , I murder you !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Say ye so ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="then see how ye frighten me '-- and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Best not ,' hissed the Lakeman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' But I must ,'-- and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Steelkilt here hissed out something , inaudible to all but the Captain ; who , to the amazement of all hands , started back , paced the deck rapidly two or three times , and then suddenly throwing down his rope , said , ' I won ' t do it -- let him go -- cut him down : d ' ye hear ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order , a pale man , with a bandaged head , arrested them -- Radney the chief mate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ever since the blow , he had lain in his berth ; but that morning , hearing the tumult on the deck , he had crept out , and thus far had watched the whole scene ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such was the state of his mouth , that he could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt , he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' You are a coward !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="hissed the Lakeman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' So I am , but take that .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The mate was in the very act of striking , when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He paused : and then pausing no more , made good his word , spite of Steelkilt ' s threat , whatever that might have been ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The three men were then cut down , all hands were turned to , and , sullenly worked by the moody seamen , the iron pumps clanged as before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a clamor was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling traitors running up , besieged the cabin door , saying they durst not consort with the crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Entreaties , cuffs , and kicks could not drive them back , so at their own instance they were put down in the ship ' s run for salvation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still , no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the contrary , it seemed , that mainly at Steelkilt ' s instigation , they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing -- namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , spite of her leak , and spite of all her other perils , the Town - Ho still maintained her mast - heads , and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment , as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground ; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat , and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct , he kept his own counsel ( at least till all was over ) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was in Radney the chief mate ' s watch ; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom , after the scene at the rigging , he insisted , against the express counsel of the captain , upon resuming the head of his watch at night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this , and one or two other circumstances , Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; During the night , Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter - deck , and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there , a little above the ship ' s side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes dozed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship , and down between this was the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Steelkilt calculated his time , and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o ' clock , in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At his leisure , he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' What are you making there ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said a shipmate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' What do you think ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what does it look like ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Like a lanyard for your bag ; but it ' s an odd one , seems to me .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Yes , rather oddish ,' said the Lakeman , holding it at arm ' s length before him ; ' but I think it will answer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shipmate , I haven ' t enough twine ,-- have you any ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But there was none in the forecastle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Then I must get some from old Rad ;' and he rose to go aft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' You don ' t mean to go a begging to HIM !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said a sailor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Why not ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you think he won ' t do me a turn , when it ' s to help himself in the end , shipmate ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and going to the mate , he looked at him quietly , and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was given him -- neither twine nor lanyard were seen again ; but the next night an iron ball , closely netted , partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman ' s monkey jacket , as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Twenty - four hours after , his trick at the silent helm -- nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman ' s hand -- that fatal hour was then to come ; and in the fore - ordaining soul of Steelkilt , the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But , gentlemen , a fool saved the would - be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet complete revenge he had , and without being the avenger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For by a mysterious fatality , Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day , when they were washing down the decks , that a stupid Teneriffe man , drawing water in the main - chains , all at once shouted out , ' There she rolls !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there she rolls !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jesu , what a whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Moby Dick !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Don Sebastian ; ' St ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dominic !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sir sailor , but do whales have christenings ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whom call you Moby Dick ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' A very white , and famous , and most deadly immortal monster , Don ;-- but that would be too long a story .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' How ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried all the young Spaniards , crowding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Nay , Dons , Dons -- nay , nay !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I cannot rehearse that now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let me get more into the air , Sirs .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' The chicha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the chicha !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Don Pedro ; ' our vigorous friend looks faint ;-- fill up his empty glass !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No need , gentlemen ; one moment , and I proceed .-- Now , gentlemen , so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship -- forgetful of the compact among the crew -- in the excitement of the moment , the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster , though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast - heads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All was now a phrensy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' The White Whale -- the White Whale !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was the cry from captain , mates , and harpooneers , who , undeterred by fearful rumours , were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish ; while the dogged crew eyed askance , and with curses , the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass , that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun , shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gentlemen , a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events , as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate , and when fast to a fish , it was his duty to sit next him , while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or slacken the line , at the word of command ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover , when the four boats were lowered , the mate ' s got the start ; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt , as he strained at his oar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After a stiff pull , their harpooneer got fast , and , spear in hand , Radney sprang to the bow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was always a furious man , it seems , in a boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now his bandaged cry was , to beach him on the whale ' s topmost back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nothing loath , his bowsman hauled him up and up , through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together ; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge , and keeling over , spilled out the standing mate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That instant , as he fell on the whale ' s slippery back , the boat righted , and was dashed aside by the swell , while Radney was tossed over into the sea , on the other flank of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He struck out through the spray , and , for an instant , was dimly seen through that veil , wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom ; seized the swimmer between his jaws ; and rearing high up with him , plunged headlong again , and went down ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Meantime , at the first tap of the boat ' s bottom , the Lakeman had slackened the line , so as to drop astern from the whirlpool ; calmly looking on , he thought his own thoughts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But a sudden , terrific , downward jerking of the boat , quickly brought his knife to the line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He cut it ; and the whale was free ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , at some distance , Moby Dick rose again , with some tatters of Radney ' s red woollen shirt , caught in the teeth that had destroyed him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In good time , the Town - Ho reached her port -- a savage , solitary place -- where no civilized creature resided ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There , headed by the Lakeman , all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms ; eventually , as it turned out , seizing a large double war - canoe of the savages , and setting sail for some other harbor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The ship ' s company being reduced to but a handful , the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated , both by night and by day , and so extreme was the hard work they underwent , that upon the vessel being ready again for sea , they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After taking counsel with his officers , he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the poop ; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale - boat , steered straight before the wind for Tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; On the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The captain presented a pistol ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With one foot on each prow of the yoked war - canoes , the Lakeman laughed him to scorn ; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock , he would bury him in bubbles and foam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' What do you want of me ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the captain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Where are you bound ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and for what are you bound ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="demanded Steelkilt ; ' no lies .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' I am bound to Tahiti for more men .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Very good ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let me board you a moment -- I come in peace .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With that he leaped from the canoe , swam to the boat ; and climbing the gunwale , stood face to face with the captain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Cross your arms , sir ; throw back your head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , repeat after me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As soon as Steelkilt leaves me , I swear to beach this boat on yonder island , and remain there six days ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If I do not , may lightning strike me !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' A pretty scholar ,' laughed the Lakeman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Adios , Senor !'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and leaping into the sea , he swam back to his comrades ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Watching the boat till it was fairly beached , and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa - nut trees , Steelkilt made sail again , and in due time arrived at Tahiti , his own place of destination ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There , luck befriended him ; two ships were about to sail for France , and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They embarked ; and so for ever got the start of their former captain , had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Some ten days after the French ships sailed , the whale - boat arrived , and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians , who had been somewhat used to the sea ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Where Steelkilt now is , gentlemen , none know ; but upon the island of Nantucket , the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead ; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="said Don Sebastian , quietly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' I am , Don .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Then I entreat you , tell me if to the best of your own convictions , this your story is in substance really true ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is so passing wonderful !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Did you get it from an unquestionable source ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bear with me if I seem to press .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Also bear with all of us , sir sailor ; for we all join in Don Sebastian ' s suit ,' cried the company , with exceeding interest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn , gentlemen ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Nay ,' said Don Sebastian ; ' but I know a worthy priest near by , who will quickly procure one for me ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="this may grow too serious .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Will you be so good as to bring the priest also , Don ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Though there are no Auto - da - Fe ' s in Lima now ,' said one of the company to another ; ' I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I see no need of this .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Excuse me for running after you , Don Sebastian ; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can .'" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="CHAPTER 55" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale - ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It may be worth while , therefore , previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is time to set the world right in this matter , by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo , Egyptian , and Grecian sculptures ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples , the pedestals of statues , and on shields , medallions , cups , and coins , the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain - armor like Saladin ' s , and a helmeted head like St . George ' s ; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed , not only in most popular pictures of the whale , but in many scientific presentations of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , by all odds , the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale ' s , is to be found in the famous cavern - pagoda of Elephanta , in India ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda , all the trades and pursuits , every conceivable avocation of man , were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No wonder then , that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the Matse Avatar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though this sculpture is half man and half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small section of him is all wrong ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda , than the broad palms of the true whale ' s majestic flukes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But go to the old Galleries , and look now at a great Christian painter ' s portrait of this fish ; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is Guido ' s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea - monster or whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor does Hogarth , in painting the same scene in his own &quot; Perseus Descending ,&quot; make out one whit better ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface , scarcely drawing one inch of water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It has a sort of howdah on its back , and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling , might be taken for the Traitors ' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald , and Jonah ' s whale , as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What shall be said of these ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for the book - binder ' s whale winding like a vine - stalk round the stock of a descending anchor -- as stamped and gilded on the backs and title - pages of many books both old and new -- that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature , imitated , I take it , from the like figures on antique vases ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though universally denominated a dolphin , I nevertheless call this book - binder ' s fish an attempt at a whale ; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century , during the Revival of Learning ; and in those days , and even down to a comparatively late period , dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d ' eau , hot springs and cold , Saratoga and Baden - Baden , come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the title - page of the original edition of the &quot; Advancement of Learning &quot; you will find some curious whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But quitting all these unprofessional attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations , by those who know ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In old Harris ' s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages , A . D . 1671 , entitled &quot; A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale , Peter Peterson of Friesland , master .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice - isles , with white bears running over their living backs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then again , there is an imposing quarto , written by one Captain Colnett , a Post Captain in the English navy , entitled &quot; A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas , for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this book is an outline purporting to be a &quot; Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico , August , 1793 , and hoisted on deck .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow - window some five feet long ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look at that popular work &quot; Goldsmith ' s Animated Nature .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged &quot; whale &quot; and a &quot; narwhale .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , again , in 1825 , Bernard Germain , Count de Lacepede , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale ( that is to say , the Right whale ), even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the placing of the cap - sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier , brother to the famous Baron ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In 1836 , he published a Natural History of Whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer , you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a word , Frederick Cuvier ' s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale , but a squash ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage ( such men seldom have ), but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , Desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a Chinese drawing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are , many queer cups and saucers inform us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for the sign - painters ' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil - dealers , what shall be said of them ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They are generally Richard III ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="whales , with dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consider !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though elephants have stood for their full - lengths , the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line - of - battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full - grown Platonian Leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship ' s deck , such is then the outlandish , eel - like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not at all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though Jeremy Bentham ' s skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly - browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy ' s other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan ' s articulated bones ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , minus only the thumb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This fin has four regular bone - fingers , the index , middle , ring , and little finger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us ,&quot; said humorous Stubb one day , &quot; he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="True , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 56" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales , and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales , I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books , both ancient and modern , especially in Pliny , Purchas , Hackluyt , Harris , Cuvier , etc ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I pass that matter by ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale ; Colnett ' s , Huggins ' s , Frederick Cuvier ' s , and Beale ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Huggins ' s is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , Beale ' s is the best ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All Beale ' s drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His frontispiece , boats attacking Sperm Whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life - like in its general effect ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J . Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That is not his fault though ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of the Right Whale , the best outline pictures are in Scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has but one picture of whaling scenes , and this is a sad deficiency , because it is by such pictures only , when at all well done , that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some details not the most correct , presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large French engravings , well executed , and taken from paintings by one Garnery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Respectively , they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might , just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean , and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The prow of the boat is partially unbroken , and is drawn just balancing upon the monster ' s spine ; and standing in that prow , for that one single incomputable flash of time , you behold an oarsman , half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale , and in the act of leaping , as if from a precipice ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The half - emptied line - tub floats on the whitened sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale , but let that pass ; since , for the life of me , I could not draw so good a one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the second engraving , the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale , that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock - slide from the Patagonian cliffs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His jets are erect , full , and black like soot ; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs , shell - fish , and other sea candies and maccaroni , which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And all the while the thick - lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep , leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake , and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle - wheels of an ocean steamer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , the foreground is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable artistic contrast , is the glassy level of a sea becalmed , the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship , and the inert mass of a dead whale , a conquered fortress , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale - pole inserted into his spout - hole ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who Garnery the painter is , or was , I know not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject , or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The French are the lads for painting action ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe , and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that triumphal hall at Versailles ; where the beholder fights his way , pell - mell , through the consecutive great battles of France ; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights , and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by , like a charge of crowned centaurs ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery , are these sea battle - pieces of Garnery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With not one tenth of England ' s experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the most part , the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety - six fac - similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager ( I honour him for a veteran ), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself &quot; H ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Durand .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a quiet noon - scene among the isles of the Pacific ; a French whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The other engraving is quite a different affair : the ship hove - to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life , with a Right Whale alongside ; the vessel ( in the act of cutting - in ) hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half - erect out of the water , like a rearing horse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 57" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of Whales in Paint ; in Teeth ; in Wood ; in Sheet - Iron ; in Stone ; in Mountains ; in Stars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On Tower - hill , as you go down to the London docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar ( or KEDGER , as the sailors say ) holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are three whales and three boats ; and one of the boats ( presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity ) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Any time these ten years , they tell me , has that man held up that picture , and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the time of his justification has now come ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping , at any rate ; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump - speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Throughout the Pacific , and also in Nantucket , and New Bedford , and Sag Harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling - scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale - teeth , or ladies ' busks wrought out of the Right Whale - bone , and other like skrimshander articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some of them have little boxes of dentistical - looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , in general , they toil with their jack - knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner ' s fancy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him , i . e ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what is called savagery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Your true whale - hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An ancient Hawaiian war - club or spear - paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , with but a bit of broken sea - shell or a shark ' s tooth , that miraculous intricacy of wooden net - work has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As with the Hawaiian savage , so with the white sailor - savage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With the same marvellous patience , and with the same single shark ' s tooth , of his one poor jack - knife , he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture , not quite as workmanlike , but as close packed in its maziness of design , as the Greek savage , Achilles ' s shield ; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness , as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage , Albert Durer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war - wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some of them are done with much accuracy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At some old gable - roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road - side door ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the porter is sleepy , the anvil - headed whale would be best ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the spires of some old - fashioned churches you will see sheet - iron whales placed there for weather - cocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with &quot; HANDS OFF !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In bony , ribby regions of the earth , where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain , you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass , which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , again , in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights ; here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But you must be a thorough whaleman , to see these sights ; and not only that , but if you wish to return to such a sight again , you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand - point , else so chance - like are such observations of the hills , that your precise , previous stand - point would require a laborious re - discovery ; like the Soloma Islands , which still remain incognita , though once high - ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo - Navis , and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a frigate ' s anchors for my bridle - bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs , would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies , to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 58" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Brit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Steering north - eastward from the Crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the Right Whale largely feeds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For leagues and leagues it undulated round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the second day , numbers of Right Whales were seen , who , secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod , with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit , which , adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths , was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As morning mowers , who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads ; even so these monsters swam , making a strange , grassy , cutting sound ; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* That part of the sea known among whalemen as the &quot; Brazil Banks &quot; does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do , because of there being shallows and soundings there , but because of this remarkable meadow - like appearance , caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes , where the Right Whale is often chased ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seen from the mast - heads , especially when they paused and were stationary for a while , their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as in the great hunting countries of India , the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such , taking them for bare , blackened elevations of the soil ; even so , often , with him , who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And even when recognised at last , their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct , in all parts , with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Indeed , in other respects , you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of the thing , this may very well be ; yet coming to specialties , where , for example , does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though , to landsmen in general , the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling ; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita , so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one ; though , by vast odds , the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters ; though but a moment ' s consideration will teach , that however baby man may brag of his science and skill , and however much , in a flattering future , that science and skill may augment ; yet for ever and for ever , to the crack of doom , the sea will insult and murder him , and pulverize the stateliest , stiffest frigate he can make ; nevertheless , by the continual repetition of these very impressions , man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The first boat we read of , floated on an ocean , that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That same ocean rolls now ; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yea , foolish mortals , Noah ' s flood is not yet subsided ; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherein differ the sea and the land , that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews , when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off - spring ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No mercy , no power but its own controls it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes , as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consider , once more , the universal cannibalism of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consider all this ; and then turn to this green , gentle , and most docile earth ; consider them both , the sea and the land ; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land , so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti , full of peace and joy , but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="God keep thee !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Push not off from that isle , thou canst never return !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 59" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Squid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Slowly wading through the meadows of brit , the Pequod still held on her way north - eastward towards the island of Java ; a gentle air impelling her keel , so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze , as three mild palms on a plain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And still , at wide intervals in the silvery night , the lonely , alluring jet would be seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But one transparent blue morning , when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea , however unattended with any stagnant calm ; when the long burnished sun - glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them , enjoining some secrecy ; when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on ; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main - mast - head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and disentangling itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a snow - slide , new slid from the hills ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it subsided , and sank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then once more arose , and silently gleamed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seemed not a whale ; and yet is this Moby Dick ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thought Daggoo ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again the phantom went down , but on re - appearing once more , with a stiletto - like cry that startled every man from his nod , the negro yelled out --&quot; There !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there again !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there she breaches !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="right ahead !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The White Whale , the White Whale !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this , the seamen rushed to the yard - arms , as in swarming - time the bees rush to the boughs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bare - headed in the sultry sun , Ahab stood on the bowsprit , and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman , cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab , so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued ; however this was , or whether his eagerness betrayed him ; whichever way it might have been , no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass , than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The four boats were soon on the water ; Ahab ' s in advance , and all swiftly pulling towards their prey ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon it went down , and while , with oars suspended , we were awaiting its reappearance , lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick , we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A vast pulpy mass , furlongs in length and breadth , of a glancing cream - colour , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms radiating from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas , as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance - like apparition of life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed --&quot; Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What was it , Sir ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The great live squid , which , they say , few whale - ships ever beheld , and returned to their ports to tell of it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Ahab said nothing ; turning his boat , he sailed back to the vessel ; the rest as silently following ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So rarely is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At times , when closely pursued , he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid ." sensical="true" />
