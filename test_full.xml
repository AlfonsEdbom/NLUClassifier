	<utterance text="CHAPTER 60" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , I have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale - line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly vapoured with tar , not impregnated with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope - maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale - line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope ' s durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale - lines ; for , though not so durable as hemp , it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic ; and I will add ( since there is an aesthetics in all things ), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat , than hemp ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of Indian ; but Manilla is as a golden - haired Circassian to behold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whale - line is only two - thirds of an inch in thickness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In length , the common sperm whale - line measures something over two hundred fathoms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm - pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese - shaped mass of densely bedded &quot; sheaves ,&quot; or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the &quot; heart ,&quot; or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody ' s arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is some advantage in this ; because these twin - tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the American tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half - inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale - boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line - tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding - cake to present to the whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye - splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Second : This arrangement is indispensable for common safety ' s sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town - crier would ever find her again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man ' s oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it from slipping out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms ( called box - line ) being coiled upon the box in the bows , it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the short - warp -- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the short - warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus the whale - line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as Indian jugglers , with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet habit -- strange thing !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what cannot habit accomplish ?-- Gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half - inch white cedar of the whale - boat , when thus hung in hangman ' s nooses ; and , like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters -- some few of which are casually chronicled -- of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam - engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is worse ; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self - adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a Mazeppa of , and run away with where the all - seeing sun himself could never pierce you out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again : as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the explosion ; so the graceful repose of the line , as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play -- this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But why say more ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All men live enveloped in whale - lines ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , ever - present perils of life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale - boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 61" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb Kills a Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents , to Queequeg it was quite a different object ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; When you see him ' quid ,&quot; said the savage , honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat , &quot; then you quick see him ' parm whale .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the Pequod ' s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying - fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the Rio de la Plata , or the in - shore ground off Peru ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was my turn to stand at the foremast - head ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No resolution could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me , I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen - mast - heads were already drowsy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The waves , too , nodded their indolent crests ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east nodded to west , and the sun over all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious agency preserved me ; with a shock I came back to life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an Ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun ' s rays like a mirror ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As if struck by some enchanter ' s wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Clear away the boats !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Luff !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , majestically turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in whispers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There go flukes !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb ' s producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker ' s boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , Stubb counted upon the honour of the capture ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Paddles were dropped , and oars came loudly into play ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And still puffing at his pipe , Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , a mighty change had come over the fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All alive to his jeopardy , he was going &quot; head out &quot;; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale ' s enormous head consists ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though apparently the most massive , it is by far the most buoyant part about him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that with ease he elevates it in the air , and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head , and such the tapering cut - water formation of the lower part , that by obliquely elevating his head , he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff - bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot - boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Start her , start her , my men !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t hurry yourselves ; take plenty of time -- but start her ; start her like thunder - claps , that ' s all ,&quot; cried Stubb , spluttering out the smoke as he spoke ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Start her , now ; give ' em the long and strong stroke , Tashtego ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Start her , Tash , my boy -- start her , all ; but keep cool , keep cool -- cucumbers is the word -- easy , easy -- only start her like grim death and grinning devils , and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves , boys -- that ' s all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Start her !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Woo - hoo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wa - hee !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="screamed the Gay - Header in reply , raising some old war - whoop to the skies ; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Kee - hee !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Kee - hee !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="yelled Daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his cage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ka - la !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Koo - loo !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="howled Queequeg , as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of Grenadier ' s steak ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , Stubb retaining his place in the van , still encouraged his men to the onset , all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained , till the welcome cry was heard --&quot; Stand up , Tashtego !-- give it to him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The harpoon was hurled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stern all !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The oarsmen backed water ; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was the magical line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An instant before , Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead , whence , by reason of its increased rapid circlings , a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the line passed round and round the loggerhead ; so also , just before reaching that point , it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb ' s hands , from which the hand - cloths , or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was like holding an enemy ' s sharp two - edged sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Wet the line !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="wet the line !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb to the tub oarsman ( him seated by the tub ) who , snatching off his hat , dashed sea - water into it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* More turns were taken , so that the line began holding its place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb and Tashtego here changed places -- stem for stern -- a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* Partly to show the indispensableness of this act , it may here be stated , that , in the old Dutch fishery , a mop was used to dash the running line with water ; in many other ships , a wooden piggin , or bailer , is set apart for that purpose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Your hat , however , is the most convenient ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat , and from its now being more tight than a harpstring , you would have thought the craft had two keels -- one cleaving the water , the other the air -- as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A continual cascade played at the bows ; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus they rushed ; each man with might and main clinging to his seat , to prevent being tossed to the foam ; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double , in order to bring down his centre of gravity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way , till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Haul in -- haul in !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb to the bowsman !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and , facing round towards the whale , all hands began pulling the boat up to him , while yet the boat was being towed on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon ranging up by his flank , Stubb , firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat , darted dart after dart into the flying fish ; at the word of command , the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale ' s horrible wallow , and then ranging up for another fling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood , which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea , sent back its reflection into every face , so that they all glowed to each other like red men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale , and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance ( by the line attached to it ), Stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pull up -- pull up !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he now cried to the bowsman , as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pull up !-- close to !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and the boat ranged along the fish ' s flank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When reaching far over the bow , Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish , and kept it there , carefully churning and churning , as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed , and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now it is struck ; for , starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his &quot; flurry ,&quot; the monster horribly wallowed in his blood , overwrapped himself in impenetrable , mad , boiling spray , so that the imperilled craft , instantly dropping astern , had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now abating in his flurry , the whale once more rolled out into view ; surging from side to side ; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout - hole , with sharp , cracking , agonized respirations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last , gush after gush of clotted red gore , as if it had been the purple lees of red wine , shot into the frighted air ; and falling back again , ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His heart had burst !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' s dead , Mr . Stubb ,&quot; said Daggoo ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes ; both pipes smoked out !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and withdrawing his own from his mouth , Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water ; and , for a moment , stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 62" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Dart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A word concerning an incident in the last chapter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="According to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale - boat pushes off from the ship , with the headsman or whale - killer as temporary steersman , and the harpooneer or whale - fastener pulling the foremost oar , the one known as the harpooneer - oar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But however prolonged and exhausting the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one ' s compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started -- what that is none know but those who have tried it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For one , I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry --&quot; Stand up , and give it to him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood - vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , I care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase ; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Crotch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Out of the trunk , the branches grow ; out of them , the twigs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , in productive subjects , grow the chapters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a notched stick of a peculiar form , some two feet in length , which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow , for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon , whose other naked , barbed end slopingly projects from the prow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler , who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch , respectively called the first and second irons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But these two harpoons , each by its own cord , are both connected with the line ; the object being this : to dart them both , if possible , one instantly after the other into the same whale ; so that if , in the coming drag , one should draw out , the other may still retain a hold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a doubling of the chances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however lightning - like in his movements , to pitch the second iron into him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , as the second iron is already connected with the line , and the line is running , hence that weapon must , at all events , be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat , somehow and somewhere ; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line ( mentioned in a preceding chapter ) making this feat , in most instances , prudently practicable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Furthermore : you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard , it thenceforth becomes a dangling , sharp - edged terror , skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale , entangling the lines , or cutting them , and making a prodigious sensation in all directions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , in general , is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All these particulars are faithfully narrated here , as they will not fail to elucidate several most important , however intricate passages , in scenes hereafter to be painted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 64" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb ' s Supper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb ' s whale had been killed some distance from the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a calm ; so , forming a tandem of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now , as we eighteen men with our thirty - six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , upon the great canal of Hang - Ho , or whatever they call it , in China , four or five laborers on the foot - path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with pig - lead in bulk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Darkness came on ; but three lights up and down in the Pequod ' s main - rigging dimly guided our way ; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment , he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night , and then handing his lantern to a seaman , went his way into the cabin , and did not come forward again until morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though , in overseeing the pursuit of this whale , Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague dissatisfaction , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod ' s decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port - holes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But by those clanking links , the vast corpse itself , not the ship , is to be moored ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tied by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel ' s and seen through the darkness of the night , which obscured the spars and rigging aloft , the two -- ship and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks , whereof one reclines while the other remains standing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* A little item may as well be related here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other ( excepting the side - fins ), its flexibility even in death , causes it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat , in order to put the chain round it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome : a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If moody Ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on deck , Stubb , his second mate , flushed with conquest , betrayed an unusual but still good - natured excitement ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck , his official superior , quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One small , helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb , was soon made strangely manifest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb was a high liver ; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; A steak , a steak , ere I sleep !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You , Daggoo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="overboard you go , and cut me one from his small !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here be it known , that though these wild fishermen do not , as a general thing , and according to the great military maxim , make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war ( at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage ), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb ; comprising the tapering extremity of the body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="About midnight that steak was cut and cooked ; and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil , Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan - head , as if that capstan were a sideboard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale ' s flesh that night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications , thousands on thousands of sharks , swarming round the dead leviathan , smackingly feasted on its fatness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull , within a few inches of the sleepers ' hearts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Peering over the side you could just see them ( as before you heard them ) wallowing in the sullen , black waters , and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How at such an apparently unassailable surface , they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls , remains a part of the universal problem of all things ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea - fight , sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship ' s decks , like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved , ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them ; and though , while the valiant butchers over the deck - table are thus cannibally carving each other ' s live meat with carving - knives all gilded and tasselled , the sharks , also , with their jewel - hilted mouths , are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat ; and though , were you to turn the whole affair upside down , it would still be pretty much the same thing , that is to say , a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties ; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic , systematically trotting alongside , to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere , or a dead slave to be decently buried ; and though one or two other like instances might be set down , touching the set terms , places , and occasions , when sharks do most socially congregate , and most hilariously feast ; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers , and in gayer or more jovial spirits , than around a dead sperm whale , moored by night to a whaleship at sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you have never seen that sight , then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil - worship , and the expediency of conciliating the devil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , as yet , Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him , no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Cook , cook !-- where ' s that old Fleece ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he cried at length , widening his legs still further , as if to form a more secure base for his supper ; and , at the same time darting his fork into the dish , as if stabbing with his lance ; &quot; cook , you cook !-- sail this way , cook !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The old black , not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour , came shambling along from his galley , for , like many old blacks , there was something the matter with his knee - pans , which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans ; this old Fleece , as they called him , came shuffling and limping along , assisting his step with his tongs , which , after a clumsy fashion , were made of straightened iron hoops ; this old Ebony floundered along , and in obedience to the word of command , came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb ' s sideboard ; when , with both hands folded before him , and resting on his two - legged cane , he bowed his arched back still further over , at the same time sideways inclining his head , so as to bring his best ear into play ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Cook ,&quot; said Stubb , rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth , &quot; don ' t you think this steak is rather overdone ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You ' ve been beating this steak too much , cook ; it ' s too tender ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t I always say that to be good , a whale - steak must be tough ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are those sharks now over the side , don ' t you see they prefer it tough and rare ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What a shindy they are kicking up !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Cook , go and talk to ' em ; tell ' em they are welcome to help themselves civilly , and in moderation , but they must keep quiet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Blast me , if I can hear my own voice ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Away , cook , and deliver my message ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , take this lantern ,&quot; snatching one from his sideboard ; &quot; now then , go and preach to ' em !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sullenly taking the offered lantern , old Fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks ; and then , with one hand dropping his light low over the sea , so as to get a good view of his congregation , with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs , and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks , while Stubb , softly crawling behind , overheard all that was said ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Fellow - critters : I ' se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Cook ,&quot; here interposed Stubb , accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder ,--&quot; Cook !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="why , damn your eyes , you mustn ' t swear that way when you ' re preaching ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ' s no way to convert sinners , cook !&quot;" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Talk to ' em gentlemanly .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Once more the sermon proceeded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Your woraciousness , fellow - critters , I don ' t blame ye so much for ; dat is natur , and can ' t be helped ; but to gobern dat wicked natur , dat is de pint ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Upon my soul , I am about of the same opinion ; so give the benediction , Fleece , and I ' ll away to my supper .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this , Fleece , holding both hands over the fishy mob , raised his shrill voice , and cried --" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Kick up de damndest row as ever you can ; fill your dam bellies ' till dey bust -- and den die .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Now , cook ,&quot; said Stubb , resuming his supper at the capstan ; &quot; stand just where you stood before , there , over against me , and pay particular attention .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; All ' dention ,&quot; said Fleece , again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well ,&quot; said Stubb , helping himself freely meanwhile ; &quot; I shall now go back to the subject of this steak ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the first place , how old are you , cook ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What dat do wid de ' teak ,&quot; said the old black , testily ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot;' Bout ninety , dey say ,&quot; he gloomily muttered ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word , so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="he cried sharply ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , you didn ' t , cook ; but I ' ll tell you what I ' m coming to , cook ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You must go home and be born over again ; you don ' t know how to cook a whale - steak yet .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Bress my soul , if I cook noder one ,&quot; he growled , angrily , turning round to depart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Come back here , cook ;-- here , hand me those tongs ;-- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Take it , I say &quot;-- holding the tongs towards him --&quot; take it , and taste it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , &quot; Best cooked ' teak I eber taste ; joosy , berry joosy .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Cook ,&quot; said Stubb , squaring himself once more ; &quot; do you belong to the church ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Passed one once in Cape - Down ,&quot; said the old man sullenly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape - Town , where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow - creatures , have you , cook !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ?&quot;" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="I mean when you die , cook ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s an awful question ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now what ' s your answer ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; When dis old brack man dies ,&quot; said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , &quot; he hisself won ' t go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Fetch him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a coach and four , as they fetched Elijah ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And fetch him where ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Up dere ,&quot; said Fleece , holding his tongs straight over his head , and keeping it there very solemnly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; So , then , you expect to go up into our main - top , do you , cook , when you are dead ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But don ' t you know the higher you climb , the colder it gets ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Main - top , eh ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Didn ' t say dat t ' all ,&quot; said Fleece , again in the sulks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; You said up there , didn ' t you ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber ' s hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you don ' t get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s a ticklish business , but must be done , or else it ' s no go ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But none of us are in heaven yet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Drop your tongs , cook , and hear my orders ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do ye hear ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hold your hat in one hand , and clap t ' other a ' top of your heart , when I ' m giving my orders , cook ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that your heart , there ?-- that ' s your gizzard !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aloft !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Hold it there now , and pay attention .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; All ' dention ,&quot; said the old black , with both hands placed as desired , vainly wriggling his grizzled head , as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well then , cook , you see this whale - steak of yours was so very bad , that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible ; you see that , don ' t you ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , for the future , when you cook another whale - steak for my private table here , the capstan , I ' ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hold the steak in one hand , and show a live coal to it with the other ; that done , dish it ; d ' ye hear ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now to - morrow , cook , when we are cutting in the fish , be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins ; have them put in pickle ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Whale as a Dish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp , and , like Stubb , eat him by his own light , as you may say ; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France , and commanded large prices there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Also , that in Henry VIIIth ' s time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Porpoises , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls , and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle - balls or veal balls ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They had a great porpoise grant from the crown ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a meat - pie nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your appetite ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb , nowadays partake of cooked whales ; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="And this reminds me that certain Englishmen , who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel -- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called &quot; fritters &quot;; which , indeed , they greatly resemble , being brown and crisp , and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives ' dough - nuts or oly - cooks , when fresh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They have such an eatable look that the most self - denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look at his hump , which would be as fine eating as the buffalo ' s ( which is esteemed a rare dish ), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the spermaceti itself , how bland and creamy that is ; like the transparent , half - jellied , white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth , yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship - biscuit into the huge oil - pots and let them fry there awhile ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn ( precisely resembling two large puddings ), they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves ' head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves ' brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf ' s head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf ' s head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him , with an &quot; Et tu Brute !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="expression ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is not , perhaps , entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence ; that appears to result , in some way , from the consideration before mentioned : i . e ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea , and eat it too by its own light ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer ; perhaps he was hung ; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen , he certainly would have been ; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Shark Massacre ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When in the Southern Fishery , a captured Sperm Whale , after long and weary toil , is brought alongside late at night , it is not , as a general thing at least , customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For that business is an exceedingly laborious one ; is not very soon completed ; and requires all hands to set about it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore , the common usage is to take in all sail ; lash the helm a ' lee ; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight , with the reservation that , until that time , anchor - watches shall be kept ; that is , two and two for an hour , each couple , the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But sometimes , especially upon the Line in the Pacific , this plan will not answer at all ; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase , that were he left so for six hours , say , on a stretch , little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In most other parts of the ocean , however , where these fish do not so largely abound , their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished , by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling - spades , a procedure notwithstanding , which , in some instances , only seems to tickle them into still greater activity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod ' s sharks ; though , to be sure , any man unaccustomed to such sights , to have looked over her side that night , would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese , and those sharks the maggots in it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , upon Stubb setting the anchor - watch after his supper was concluded ; and when , accordingly , Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck , no small excitement was created among the sharks ; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side , and lowering three lanterns , so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea , these two mariners , darting their long whaling - spades , kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks ,* by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls , seemingly their only vital part ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts , the marksmen could not always hit their mark ; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They viciously snapped , not only at each other ' s disembowelments , but like flexible bows , bent round , and bit their own ; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth , to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was this all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones , after what might be called the individual life had departed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin , one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg ' s hand off , when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* The whaling - spade used for cutting - in is made of the very best steel ; is about the bigness of a man ' s spread hand ; and in general shape , corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named ; only its sides are perfectly flat , and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible ; and when being used is occasionally honed , just like a razor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In its socket , a stiff pole , from twenty to thirty feet long , is inserted for a handle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Queequeg no care what god made him shark ,&quot; said the savage , agonizingly lifting his hand up and down ; &quot; wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god ; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin .&quot;" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Cutting In ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble ; every sailor a butcher ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the first place , the enormous cutting tackles , among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green , and which no single man can possibly lift -- this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main - top and firmly lashed to the lower mast - head , the strongest point anywhere above a ship ' s deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The end of the hawser - like rope winding through these intricacies , was then conducted to the windlass , and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale ; to this block the great blubber hook , weighing some one hundred pounds , was attached ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now suspended in stages over the side , Starbuck and Stubb , the mates , armed with their long spades , began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side - fins ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This done , a broad , semicircular line is cut round the hole , the hook is inserted , and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus , now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When instantly , the entire ship careens over on her side ; every bolt in her starts like the nail - heads of an old house in frosty weather ; she trembles , quivers , and nods her frighted mast - heads to the sky ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="More and more she leans over to the whale , while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows ; till at last , a swift , startling snap is heard ; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale , and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange , so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water , and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the &quot; scarf ,&quot; simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb , the mates ; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off , and indeed by that very act itself , it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main - top ; the men at the windlass then cease heaving , and for a moment or two the prodigious blood - dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky , and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings , else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long , keen weapon called a boarding - sword , and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Into this hole , the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber , in order to prepare for what follows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whereupon , this accomplished swordsman , warning all hands to stand off , once more makes a scientific dash at the mass , and with a few sidelong , desperate , lunging slicings , severs it completely in twain ; so that while the short lower part is still fast , the long upper strip , called a blanket - piece , swings clear , and is all ready for lowering ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The heavers forward now resume their song , and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale , the other is slowly slackened away , and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath , into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber - room ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket - piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the heavers singing , the blubber - room gentlemen coiling , the mates scarfing , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general friction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 68" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Blanket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject , the skin of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My original opinion remains unchanged ; but it is only an opinion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The question is , what and where is the skin of the whale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Already you know what his blubber is ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That blubber is something of the consistence of firm , close - grained beef , but tougher , more elastic and compact , and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature ' s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness , yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption ; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale ' s body but that same blubber ; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal , if reasonably dense , what can that be but the skin ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="True , from the unmarred dead body of the whale , you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin , transparent substance , somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass , only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin ; that is , previous to being dried , when it not only contracts and thickens , but becomes rather hard and brittle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have several such dried bits , which I use for marks in my whale - books ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is transparent , as I said before ; and being laid upon the printed page , I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At any rate , it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles , as you may say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what I am driving at here is this ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That same infinitely thin , isinglass substance , which , I admit , invests the entire body of the whale , is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature , as the skin of the skin , so to speak ; for it were simply ridiculous to say , that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new - born child ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no more of this ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale ; then , when this skin , as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale , will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil ; and , when it is considered that , in quantity , or rather weight , that oil , in its expressed state , is only three fourths , and not the entire substance of the coat ; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass , a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Reckoning ten barrels to the ton , you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale ' s skin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In life , the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re - crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array , something like those in the finest Italian line engravings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were engraved upon the body itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is this all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In some instances , to the quick , observant eye , those linear marks , as in a veritable engraving , but afford the ground for far other delineations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These are hieroglyphical ; that is , if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics , then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular , I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like those mystic rocks , too , the mystic - marked whale remains undecipherable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents , he not seldom displays the back , and more especially his flanks , effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance , by reason of numerous rude scratches , altogether of an irregular , random aspect ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I should say that those New England rocks on the sea - coast , which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs -- I should say , that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales ; for I have most remarked them in the large , full - grown bulls of the species ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It has already been said , that it is stript from him in long pieces , called blanket - pieces ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like most sea - terms , this one is very happy and significant ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an Indian poncho slipt over his head , and skirting his extremity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body , that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers , in all seas , times , and tides ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What would become of a Greenland whale , say , in those shuddering , icy seas of the North , if unsupplied with his cosy surtout ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="True , other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters ; but these , be it observed , are your cold - blooded , lungless fish , whose very bellies are refrigerators ; creatures , that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg , as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire ; whereas , like man , the whale has lungs and warm blood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Freeze his blood , and he dies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How wonderful is it then -- except after explanation -- that this great monster , to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man ; how wonderful that he should be found at home , immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="where , when seamen fall overboard , they are sometimes found , months afterwards , perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice , as a fly is found glued in amber ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But more surprising is it to know , as has been proved by experiment , that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It does seem to me , that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality , and the rare virtue of thick walls , and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="admire and model thyself after the whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do thou , too , remain warm among ice ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The sea - vultures all in pious mourning , the air - sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In life but few of them would have helped the whale , I ween , if peradventure he had needed it ; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="from which not the mightiest whale is free ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Espied by some timid man - of - war or blundering discovery - vessel from afar , when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls , nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun , and the white spray heaving high against it ; straightway the whale ' s unharming corpse , with trembling fingers is set down in the log -- SHOALS , ROCKS , AND BREAKERS HEREABOUTS : BEWARE !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And for years afterwards , perhaps , ships shun the place ; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum , because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Thus , while in life the great whale ' s body may have been a real terror to his foes , in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Sphynx ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan , he was beheaded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat , upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves : and not without reason ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck ; on the contrary , where his head and body seem to join , there , in that very place , is the thickest part of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Remember , also , that the surgeon must operate from above , some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject , and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured , rolling , and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bear in mind , too , that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh ; and in that subterraneous manner , without so much as getting one single peep into the ever - contracting gash thus made , he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent , interdicted parts , and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you not marvel , then , at Stubb ' s boast , that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When first severed , the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That done , if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , with a full grown leviathan this is impossible ; for the sperm whale ' s head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk , and completely to suspend such a burden as that , even by the immense tackles of a whaler , this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers ' scales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pequod ' s whale being decapitated and the body stripped , the head was hoisted against the ship ' s side -- about half way out of the sea , so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="When this last task was accomplished it was noon , and the seamen went below to their dinner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Taking a few turns on the quarter - deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the main - chains he took Stubb ' s long spade -- still remaining there after the whale ' s Decapitation -- and striking it into the lower part of the half - suspended mass , placed its other end crutch - wise under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a black and hooded head ; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm , it seemed the Sphynx ' s in the desert ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Speak , thou vast and venerable head ,&quot; muttered Ahab , &quot; which , though ungarnished with a beard , yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses ; speak , mighty head , and tell us the secret thing that is in thee ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Aye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , now , that ' s cheering ,&quot; cried Ahab , suddenly erecting himself , while whole thunder - clouds swept aside from his brow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man .-- Where away ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Three points on the starboard bow , sir , and bringing down her breeze to us !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="CHAPTER 71" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Jeroboam ' s Story ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hand in hand , ship and breeze blew on ; but the breeze came faster than the ship , and soon the Pequod began to rock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By and by , through the glass the stranger ' s boats and manned mast - heads proved her a whale - ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as she was so far to windward , and shooting by , apparently making a passage to some other ground , the Pequod could not hope to reach her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So the signal was set to see what response would be made ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here be it said , that like the vessels of military marines , the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal ; all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached , every captain is provided with it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thereby , the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean , even at considerable distances and with no small facility ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pequod ' s signal was at last responded to by the stranger ' s setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Squaring her yards , she bore down , ranged abeam under the Pequod ' s lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the side - ladder was being rigged by Starbuck ' s order to accommodate the visiting captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat ' s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board , and that Mayhew , her captain , was fearful of infecting the Pequod ' s company ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , though himself and boat ' s crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle - shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this did by no means prevent all communications ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship , the Jeroboam ' s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod , as she heavily forged through the sea ( for by this time it blew very fresh ), with her main - topsail aback ; though , indeed , at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave , the boat would be pushed some way ahead ; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam ' s boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A long - skirted , cabalistically - cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A deep , settled , fanatic delirium was in his eyes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So soon as this figure had been first descried , Stubb had exclaimed --&quot; That ' s he !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that ' s he !-- the long - togged scaramouch the Town - Ho ' s company told us of !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town - Ho ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="According to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His story was this :" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap - door , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest - pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A strange , apostolic whim having seized him , he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady , common - sense exterior , and offered himself as a green - hand candidate for the Jeroboam ' s whaling voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship ' s getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a freshet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel , and commanded the captain to jump overboard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He published his manifesto , whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar - general of all Oceanica ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things ;-- the dark , daring play of his sleepless , excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium , united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover , they were afraid of him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As such a man , however , was not of much practical use in the ship , especially as he refused to work except when he pleased , the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him ; but apprised that that individual ' s intention was to land him in the first convenient port , the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials -- devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition , in case this intention was carried out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship , not a man of them would remain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated , say or do what he would ; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The consequence of all this was , that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates ; and since the epidemic had broken out , he carried a higher hand than ever ; declaring that the plague , as he called it , was at his sole command ; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sailors , mostly poor devils , cringed , and some of them fawned before him ; in obedience to his instructions , sometimes rendering him personal homage , as to a god ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such things may seem incredible ; but , however wondrous , they are true ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless self - deception of the fanatic himself , as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it is time to return to the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I fear not thy epidemic , man ,&quot; said Ahab from the bulwarks , to Captain Mayhew , who stood in the boat ' s stern ; &quot; come on board .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But now Gabriel started to his feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Think , think of the fevers , yellow and bilious !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Beware of the horrible plague !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Gabriel !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gabriel !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Captain Mayhew ; &quot; thou must either --&quot; But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead , and its seethings drowned all speech ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hast thou seen the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="demanded Ahab , when the boat drifted back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Think , think of thy whale - boat , stoven and sunk !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Beware of the horrible tail !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I tell thee again , Gabriel , that --&quot; But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nothing was said for some moments , while a succession of riotous waves rolled by , which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling , not heaving it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , the hoisted sperm whale ' s head jogged about very violently , and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When this interlude was over , Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick ; not , however , without frequent interruptions from Gabriel , whenever his name was mentioned , and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home , when upon speaking a whale - ship , her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick , and the havoc he had made ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Greedily sucking in this intelligence , Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale , in case the monster should be seen ; in his gibbering insanity , pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated ; the Shakers receiving the Bible ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when , some year or two afterwards , Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast - heads , Macey , the chief mate , burned with ardour to encounter him ; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity , despite all the archangel ' s denunciations and forewarnings , Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With them he pushed off ; and , after much weary pulling , and many perilous , unsuccessful onsets , he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , Gabriel , ascending to the main - royal mast - head , was tossing one arm in frantic gestures , and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , while Macey , the mate , was standing up in his boat ' s bow , and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale , and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance , lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a broad white shadow rose from the sea ; by its quick , fanning motion , temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next instant , the luckless mate , so full of furious life , was smitten bodily into the air , and making a long arc in his descent , fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not a chip of the boat was harmed , nor a hair of any oarsman ' s head ; but the mate for ever sank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is well to parenthesize here , that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm - Whale Fishery , this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sometimes , nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated ; oftener the boat ' s bow is knocked off , or the thigh - board , in which the headsman stands , is torn from its place and accompanies the body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But strangest of all is the circumstance , that in more instances than one , when the body has been recovered , not a single mark of violence is discernible ; the man being stark dead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whole calamity , with the falling form of Macey , was plainly descried from the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Raising a piercing shriek --&quot; The vial !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the vial !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gabriel called off the terror - stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence ; because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore - announced it , instead of only making a general prophecy , which any one might have done , and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He became a nameless terror to the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mayhew having concluded his narration , Ahab put such questions to him , that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale , if opportunity should offer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To which Ahab answered --&quot; Aye .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Straightway , then , Gabriel once more started to his feet , glaring upon the old man , and vehemently exclaimed , with downward pointed finger --&quot; Think , think of the blasphemer -- dead , and down there !-- beware of the blasphemer ' s end !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab stolidly turned aside ; then said to Mayhew , &quot; Captain , I have just bethought me of my letter - bag ; there is a letter for one of thy officers , if I mistake not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starbuck , look over the bag .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Every whale - ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships , whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed , depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , most letters never reach their mark ; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was sorely tumbled , damp , and covered with a dull , spotted , green mould , in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of such a letter , Death himself might well have been the post - boy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Can ' st not read it ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Give it me , man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , aye , it ' s but a dim scrawl ;-- what ' s this ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As he was studying it out , Starbuck took a long cutting - spade pole , and with his knife slightly split the end , to insert the letter there , and in that way , hand it to the boat , without its coming any closer to the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , Ahab holding the letter , muttered , &quot; Mr . Har -- yes , Mr . Harry --( a woman ' s pinny hand ,-- the man ' s wife , I ' ll wager )-- Aye -- Mr . Harry Macey , Ship Jeroboam ;-- why it ' s Macey , and he ' s dead !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Poor fellow !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="poor fellow !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and from his wife ,&quot; sighed Mayhew ; &quot; but let me have it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Nay , keep it thyself ,&quot; cried Gabriel to Ahab ; &quot; thou art soon going that way .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Curses throttle thee !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="yelled Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Mayhew , stand by now to receive it &quot;; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck ' s hands , he caught it in the slit of the pole , and reached it over towards the boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as he did so , the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing ; the boat drifted a little towards the ship ' s stern ; so that , as if by magic , the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel ' s eager hand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He clutched it in an instant , seized the boat - knife , and impaling the letter on it , sent it thus loaded back into the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It fell at Ahab ' s feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars , and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As , after this interlude , the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale , many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 72" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Monkey - Rope ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the tumultuous business of cutting - in and attending to a whale , there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now hands are wanted here , and then again hands are wanted there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is no staying in any one place ; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We must now retrace our way a little ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale ' s back , the blubber - hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg , whose duty it was , as harpooneer , to descend upon the monster ' s back for the special purpose referred to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whale , be it observed , lies almost entirely submerged , excepting the immediate parts operated upon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So down there , some ten feet below the level of the deck , the poor harpooneer flounders about , half on the whale and half in the water , as the vast mass revolves like a tread - mill beneath him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the occasion in question , Queequeg figured in the Highland costume -- a shirt and socks -- in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Being the savage ' s bowsman , that is , the person who pulled the bow - oar in his boat ( the second one from forward ), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard - scrabble scramble upon the dead whale ' s back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You have seen Italian organ - boys holding a dancing - ape by a long cord ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Just so , from the ship ' s steep side , did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey - rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a humorously perilous business for both of us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , before we proceed further , it must be said that the monkey - rope was fast at both ends ; fast to Queequeg ' s broad canvas belt , and fast to my narrow leather one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that for better or for worse , we two , for the time , were wedded ; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more , then both usage and honour demanded , that instead of cutting the cord , it should drag me down in his wake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , then , an elongated Siamese ligature united us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother ; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then , that while earnestly watching his motions , I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two ; that my free will had received a mortal wound ; and that another ' s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore , I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence ; for its even - handed equity never could have so gross an injustice ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yet still further pondering -- while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship , which would threaten to jam him -- still further pondering , I say , I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes ; only , in most cases , he , one way or other , has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If your banker breaks , you snap ; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills , you die ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="True , you may say that , by exceeding caution , you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But handle Queequeg ' s monkey - rope heedfully as I would , sometimes he jerked it so , that I came very near sliding overboard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor could I possibly forget that , do what I would , I only had the management of one end of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* The monkey - rope is found in all whalers ; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb , in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey - rope holder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship -- where he would occasionally fall , from the incessant rolling and swaying of both ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night , the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass -- the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And right in among those sharks was Queequeg ; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale , the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie , it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Accordingly , besides the monkey - rope , with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark -- he was provided with still another protection ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Suspended over the side in one of the stages , Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale - spades , wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very disinterested and benevolent of them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They meant Queequeg ' s best happiness , I admit ; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him , and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood - muddled water , those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But poor Queequeg , I suppose , straining and gasping there with that great iron hook -- poor Queequeg , I suppose , only prayed to his Yojo , and gave up his life into the hands of his gods ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , well , my dear comrade and twin - brother , thought I , as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea -- what matters it , after all ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That unsounded ocean you gasp in , is Life ; those sharks , your foes ; those spades , your friends ; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril , poor lad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But courage !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there is good cheer in store for you , Queequeg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For now , as with blue lips and blood - shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side ; the steward advances , and with a benevolent , consolatory glance hands him -- what ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some hot Cognac ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="hands him , ye gods !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ginger ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do I smell ginger ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="suspiciously asked Stubb , coming near ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes , this must be ginger ,&quot; peering into the as yet untasted cup ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then standing as if incredulous for a while , he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying , &quot; Ginger ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ginger ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and will you have the goodness to tell me , Mr . Dough - Boy , where lies the virtue of ginger ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ginger !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="is ginger the sort of fuel you use , Dough - boy , to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ginger !-- what the devil is ginger ?-- sea - coal ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="firewood ?-- lucifer matches ?-- tinder ?-- gunpowder ?-- what the devil is ginger , I say , that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business ,&quot; he suddenly added , now approaching Starbuck , who had just come from forward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Will you look at that kannakin , sir ; smell of it , if you please .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then watching the mate ' s countenance , he added , &quot; The steward , Mr . Starbuck , had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg , there , this instant off the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is the steward an apothecary , sir ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half - drowned man ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I trust not ,&quot; said Starbuck , &quot; it is poor stuff enough .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye , steward ,&quot; cried Stubb , &quot; we ' ll teach you to drug it harpooneer ; none of your apothecary ' s medicine here ; you want to poison us , do ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all , and pocket the proceeds , do ye ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It was not me ,&quot; cried Dough - Boy , &quot; it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board ; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits , but only this ginger - jub -- so she called it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ginger - jub !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="you gingerly rascal !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="take that !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and run along with ye to the lockers , and get something better ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I hope I do no wrong , Mr . Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is the captain ' s orders -- grog for the harpooneer on a whale .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Enough ,&quot; replied Starbuck , &quot; only don ' t hit him again , but --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , I never hurt when I hit , except when I hit a whale or something of that sort ; and this fellow ' s a weazel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What were you about saying , sir ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Only this : go down with him , and get what thou wantest thyself .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When Stubb reappeared , he came with a dark flask in one hand , and a sort of tea - caddy in the other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The first contained strong spirits , and was handed to Queequeg ; the second was Aunt Charity ' s gift , and that was freely given to the waves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 73" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale ; and Then Have a Talk Over Him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale ' s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod ' s side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the present other matters press , and the best we can do now for the head , is to pray heaven the tackles may hold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , during the past night and forenoon , the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea , which , by its occasional patches of yellow brit , gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales , a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures ; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all , and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat ; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded , to the surprise of all , the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day , if opportunity offered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor was this long wanting ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tall spouts were seen to leeward ; and two boats , Stubb ' s and Flask ' s , were detached in pursuit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pulling further and further away , they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast - head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But suddenly in the distance , they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water , and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight , in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So close did the monster come to the hull , that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice ; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom , within three rods of the planks , he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving under the keel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Cut , cut !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was the cry from the ship to the boats , which , for one instant , seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel ' s side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But having plenty of line yet in the tubs , and the whale not sounding very rapidly , they paid out abundance of rope , and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical ; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction , and still plied their oars in another , the contending strain threatened to take them under ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And they stuck to it till they did gain it ; when instantly , a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel , as the strained line , scraping beneath the ship , suddenly rose to view under her bows , snapping and quivering ; and so flinging off its drippings , that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water , while the whale beyond also rose to sight , and once more the boats were free to fly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the fagged whale abated his speed , and blindly altering his course , went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him , so that they performed a complete circuit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , they hauled more and more upon their lines , till close flanking him on both sides , Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance ; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went , while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale ' s body , rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled , thirstily drinking at every new gash , as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last his spout grew thick , and with a frightful roll and vomit , he turned upon his back a corpse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes , and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing , some conversation ensued between them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard ,&quot; said Stubb , not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Wants with it ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Flask , coiling some spare line in the boat ' s bow , &quot; did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale ' s head hoisted on her starboard side , and at the same time a Right Whale ' s on the larboard ; did you never hear , Stubb , that that ship can never afterwards capsize ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why not ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I don ' t know , but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so , and he seems to know all about ships ' charms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I sometimes think he ' ll charm the ship to no good at last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I don ' t half like that chap , Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake ' s head , Stubb ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sink him !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I never look at him at all ; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night , and he standing hard by the bulwarks , and no one by ; look down there , Flask &quot;-- pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands --&quot; Aye , will I !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Flask , I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ' s the devil , I say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The reason why you don ' t see his tail , is because he tucks it up out of sight ; he carries it coiled away in his pocket , I guess ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Blast him !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="now that I think of it , he ' s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He sleeps in his boots , don ' t he ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He hasn ' t got any hammock ; but I ' ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No doubt , and it ' s because of his cursed tail ; he coils it down , do ye see , in the eye of the rigging .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s the old man have so much to do with him for ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Striking up a swap or a bargain , I suppose .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Bargain ?-- about what ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why , do ye see , the old man is hard bent after that White Whale , and the devil there is trying to come round him , and get him to swap away his silver watch , or his soul , or something of that sort , and then he ' ll surrender Moby Dick .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pooh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb , you are skylarking ; how can Fedallah do that ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I don ' t know , Flask , but the devil is a curious chap , and a wicked one , I tell ye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why , they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag - ship once , switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike , and inquiring if the old governor was at home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , he was at home , and asked the devil what he wanted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The devil , switching his hoofs , up and says , ' I want John .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' What for ?'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="says the old governor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' What business is that of yours ,' says the devil , getting mad ,--' I want to use him .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Take him ,' says the governor -- and by the Lord , Flask , if the devil didn ' t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him , I ' ll eat this whale in one mouthful ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But look sharp -- ain ' t you all ready there ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , then , pull ahead , and let ' s get the whale alongside .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I think I remember some such story as you were telling ,&quot; said Flask , when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship , &quot; but I can ' t remember where .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Three Spaniards ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Adventures of those three bloody - minded soladoes ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Did ye read it there , Flask ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I guess ye did ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No : never saw such a book ; heard of it , though ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But now , tell me , Stubb , do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now , was the same you say is now on board the Pequod ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Am I the same man that helped kill this whale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Doesn ' t the devil live for ever ; who ever heard that the devil was dead ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if the devil has a latch - key to get into the admiral ' s cabin , don ' t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tell me that , Mr ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Flask ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; How old do you suppose Fedallah is , Stubb ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Do you see that mainmast there ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="pointing to the ship ; &quot; well , that ' s the figure one ; now take all the hoops in the Pequod ' s hold , and string along in a row with that mast , for oughts , do you see ; well , that wouldn ' t begin to be Fedallah ' s age ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor all the coopers in creation couldn ' t show hoops enough to make oughts enough .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But see here , Stubb , I thought you a little boasted just now , that you meant to give Fedallah a sea - toss , if you got a good chance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , if he ' s so old as all those hoops of yours come to , and if he is going to live for ever , what good will it do to pitch him overboard -- tell me that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Give him a good ducking , anyhow .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But he ' d crawl back .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Duck him again ; and keep ducking him .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you , though -- yes , and drown you -- what then ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I should like to see him try it ; I ' d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn ' t dare to show his face in the admiral ' s cabin again for a long while , let alone down in the orlop there , where he lives , and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Damn the devil , Flask ; so you suppose I ' m afraid of the devil ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who ' s afraid of him , except the old governor who daresn ' t catch him and put him in double - darbies , as he deserves , but lets him go about kidnapping people ; aye , and signed a bond with him , that all the people the devil kidnapped , he ' d roast for him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s a governor !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Do I suppose it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You ' ll know it before long , Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I am going now to keep a sharp look - out on him ; and if I see anything very suspicious going on , I ' ll just take him by the nape of his neck , and say -- Look here , Beelzebub , you don ' t do it ; and if he makes any fuss , by the Lord I ' ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail , take it to the capstan , and give him such a wrenching and heaving , that his tail will come short off at the stump -- do you see ; and then , I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion , he ' ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And what will you do with the tail , Stubb ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Do with it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sell it for an ox whip when we get home ;-- what else ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Now , do you mean what you say , and have been saying all along , Stubb ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mean or not mean , here we are at the ship .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The boats were here hailed , to tow the whale on the larboard side , where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Didn ' t I tell you so ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Flask ; &quot; yes , you ' ll soon see this right whale ' s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti ' s .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In good time , Flask ' s saying proved true ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As before , the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale ' s head , now , by the counterpoise of both heads , she regained her even keel ; though sorely strained , you may well believe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , when on one side you hoist in Locke ' s head , you go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in Kant ' s and you come back again ; but in very poor plight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , some minds for ever keep trimming boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , ye foolish !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="throw all these thunder - heads overboard , and then you will float light and right ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In disposing of the body of a right whale , when brought alongside the ship , the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale ; only , in the latter instance , the head is cut off whole , but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck , with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown - piece ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But nothing like this , in the present case , had been done ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The carcases of both whales had dropped astern ; and the head - laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale ' s head , and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And Ahab chanced so to stand , that the Parsee occupied his shadow ; while , if the Parsee ' s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with , and lengthen Ahab ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the crew toiled on , Laplandish speculations were bandied among them , concerning all these passing things ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 74" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Sperm Whale ' s Head -- Contrasted View ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , now , are two great whales , laying their heads together ; let us join them , and lay together our own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of the grand order of folio leviathans , the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They are the only whales regularly hunted by man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To the Nantucketer , they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads ; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod ' s side ; and as we may freely go from one to the other , by merely stepping across the deck :-- where , I should like to know , will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the first place , you are struck by the general contrast between these heads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Both are massive enough in all conscience ; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale ' s which the Right Whale ' s sadly lacks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is more character in the Sperm Whale ' s head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As you behold it , you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him , in point of pervading dignity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the present instance , too , this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit , giving token of advanced age and large experience ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In short , he is what the fishermen technically call a &quot; grey - headed whale .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads -- namely , the two most important organs , the eye and the ear ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of either whale ' s jaw , if you narrowly search , you will at last see a lashless eye , which you would fancy to be a young colt ' s eye ; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , from this peculiar sideway position of the whale ' s eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a word , the position of the whale ' s eyes corresponds to that of a man ' s ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways survey objects through your ears ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side - line of sight ; and about thirty more behind it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with dagger uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two fronts ( side fronts ): for what is it that makes the front of a man -- what , indeed , but his eyes ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover , while in most other animals that I can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale ' s eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry - box with two joined sashes for his window ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But with the whale , these two sashes are separately inserted , making two distinct windows , but sadly impairing the view ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This peculiarity of the whale ' s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery ; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I must be content with a hint ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So long as a man ' s eyes are open in the light , the act of seeing is involuntary ; that is , he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , any one ' s experience will teach him , that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to examine any two things -- however large or however small -- at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if you now come to separate these two objects , and surround each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How is it , then , with the whale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="True , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more comprehensive , combining , and subtle than man ' s , that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , strictly investigated , is there any incongruity in this comparison ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is lodged a little behind the eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With respect to their ears , this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While the ear of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane , so as to be quite imperceptible from without ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is it not curious , that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye , and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare ' s ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel ' s great telescope ; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals ; would that make him any longer of sight , or sharper of hearing ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not at all .-- Why then do you try to &quot; enlarge &quot; your mind ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Subtilize it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let us now with whatever levers and steam - engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale ' s head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But let us hold on here by this tooth , and look about us where we are ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What a really beautiful and chaste - looking mouth !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="from floor to ceiling , lined , or rather papered with a glistening white membrane , glossy as bridal satins ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff - box , with the hinge at one end , instead of one side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific portcullis ; and such , alas !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right - angles with his body , for all the world like a ship ' s jib - boom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This whale is not dead ; he is only dispirited ; out of sorts , perhaps ; hypochondriac ; and so supine , that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed , leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight , a reproach to all his tribe , who must , no doubt , imprecate lock - jaws upon him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In most cases this lower jaw -- being easily unhinged by a practised artist -- is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth , and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles , including canes , umbrella - stocks , and handles to riding - whips ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a long , weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board , as if it were an anchor ; and when the proper time comes -- some few days after the other work -- Queequeg , Daggoo , and Tashtego , being all accomplished dentists , are set to drawing teeth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a keen cutting - spade , Queequeg lances the gums ; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts , and a tackle being rigged from aloft , they drag out these teeth , as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are generally forty - two teeth in all ; in old whales , much worn down , but undecayed ; nor filled after our artificial fashion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs , and piled away like joists for building houses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 75" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Right Whale ' s Head -- Contrasted View ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Crossing the deck , let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale ' s head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale ' s head may be compared to a Roman war - chariot ( especially in front , where it is so broadly rounded ); so , at a broad view , the Right Whale ' s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot - toed shoe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker ' s last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And in this same last or shoe , that old woman of the nursery tale , with the swarming brood , might very comfortably be lodged , she and all her progeny ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects , according to your point of view ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you stand on its summit and look at these two F - shaped spoutholes , you would take the whole head for an enormous bass - viol , and these spiracles , the apertures in its sounding - board ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , again , if you fix your eye upon this strange , crested , comb - like incrustation on the top of the mass -- this green , barnacled thing , which the Greenlanders call the &quot; crown ,&quot; and the Southern fishers the &quot; bonnet &quot; of the Right Whale ; fixing your eyes solely on this , you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak , with a bird ' s nest in its crotch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At any rate , when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet , such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you ; unless , indeed , your fancy has been fixed by the technical term &quot; crown &quot; also bestowed upon it ; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea , whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if this whale be a king , he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look at that hanging lower lip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what a huge sulk and pout is there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a sulk and pout , by carpenter ' s measurement , about twenty feet long and five feet deep ; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A great pity , now , that this unfortunate whale should be hare - lipped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The fissure is about a foot across ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast , when earthquakes caused the beach to gape ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Over this lip , as over a slippery threshold , we now slide into the mouth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon my word were I at Mackinaw , I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Good Lord !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="is this the road that Jonah went ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The roof is about twelve feet high , and runs to a pretty sharp angle , as if there were a regular ridge - pole there ; while these ribbed , arched , hairy sides , present us with those wondrous , half vertical , scimetar - shaped slats of whalebone , say three hundred on a side , which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone , form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres , through which the Right Whale strains the water , and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish , when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the central blinds of bone , as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious marks , curves , hollows , and ridges , whereby some whalemen calculate the creature ' s age , as the age of an oak by its circular rings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable , yet it has the savor of analogical probability ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In old times , there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous &quot; whiskers &quot; inside of the whale ' s mouth ;* another , &quot; hogs ' bristles &quot;; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language : &quot; There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper CHOP , which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker , or rather a moustache , consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As every one knows , these same &quot; hogs ' bristles ,&quot; &quot; fins ,&quot; &quot; whiskers ,&quot; &quot; blinds ,&quot; or whatever you please , furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in this particular , the demand has long been on the decline ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was in Queen Anne ' s time that the bone was in its glory , the farthingale being then all the fashion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like thoughtlessness , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection ; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment , and , standing in the Right Whale ' s mouth , look around you afresh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about , would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ , and gazing upon its thousand pipes ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey -- the tongue , which is glued , as it were , to the floor of the mouth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This particular tongue now before us ; at a passing glance I should say it was a six - barreler ; that is , it will yield you about that amount of oil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with -- that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To sum up , then : in the Right Whale ' s there is no great well of sperm ; no ivory teeth at all ; no long , slender mandible of a lower jaw , like the Sperm Whale ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone ; no huge lower lip ; and scarcely anything of a tongue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again , the Right Whale has two external spout - holes , the Sperm Whale only one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale ' s there ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is the same he died with , only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie - like placidity , born of a speculative indifference as to death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But mark the other head ' s expression ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See that amazing lower lip , pressed by accident against the vessel ' s side , so as firmly to embrace the jaw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic ; the Sperm Whale , a Platonian , who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 76" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Battering - Ram ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere quitting , for the nonce , the Sperm Whale ' s head , I would have you , as a sensible physiologist , simply -- particularly remark its front aspect , in all its compacted collectedness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated , intelligent estimate of whatever battering - ram power may be lodged there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here is a vital point ; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself , or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling , but not the less true events , perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale , the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water ; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards , so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom - like lower jaw ; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head , much in the same way , indeed , as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose ; and that what nose he has -- his spout hole -- is on the top of his head ; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head , nearly one third of his entire length from the front ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherefore , you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale ' s head is a dead , blind wall , without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Furthermore , you are now to consider that only in the extreme , lower , backward sloping part of the front of the head , is there the slightest vestige of bone ; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Finally , though , as will soon be revealed , its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil ; yet , you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Just so with the head ; but with this difference : about the head this envelope , though not so thick , is of a boneless toughness , inestimable by any man who has not handled it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The severest pointed harpoon , the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm , impotently rebounds from it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses ' hoofs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I do not think that any sensation lurks in it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bethink yourself also of another thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When two large , loaded Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks , what do the sailors do ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They do not suspend between them , at the point of coming contact , any merely hard substance , like iron or wood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , they hold there a large , round wad of tow and cork , enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox - hide ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow - bars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But supplementary to this , it has hypothetically occurred to me , that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them , capable , at will , of distension or contraction ; and as the Sperm Whale , as far as I know , has no such provision in him ; considering , too , the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface , and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water ; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope ; considering the unique interior of his head ; it has hypothetically occurred to me , I say , that those mystical lung - celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air , so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If this be so , fancy the irresistibleness of that might , to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , mark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unerringly impelling this dead , impregnable , uninjurable wall , and this most buoyant thing within ; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life , only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is -- by the cord ; and all obedient to one volition , as the smallest insect ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster ; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats ; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity , and be ready to abide by this ; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien , and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific , you would not elevate one hair of your eye - brow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter ; how small the chances for the provincials then ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess ' s veil at Lais ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 77" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Great Heidelburgh Tun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now comes the Baling of the Case ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to comprehend it aright , you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Regarding the Sperm Whale ' s head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins ,* whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin , and then you have two almost equal parts , which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* Quoin is not a Euclidean term ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know not that it has been defined before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The lower subdivided part , called the junk , is one immense honeycomb of oil , formed by the crossing and recrossing , into ten thousand infiltrated cells , of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The upper part , known as the Case , may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front , so the whale ' s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover , as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys , so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ; namely , the highly - prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure , limpid , and odoriferous state ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though in life it remains perfectly fluid , yet , upon exposure to the air , after death , it soon begins to concrete ; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A large whale ' s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl - coloured membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale ' s case ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since -- as has been elsewhere set forth -- the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty - six feet for the depth of the tun , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship ' s side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As in decapitating the whale , the operator ' s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus much being said , attend now , I pray you , to that marvellous and -- in this particular instance -- almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale ' s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 78" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Cistern and Buckets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nimble as a cat , Tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard - arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single - sheaved block ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Securing this block , so that it hangs down from the yard - arm , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , hand - over - hand , down the other part , the Indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There -- still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries -- he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A short - handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure - hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the time this cautious search is over , a stout iron - bound bucket , precisely like a well - bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Inserting this pole into the bucket , Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun , till it entirely disappears ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all bubbling like a dairy - maid ' s pail of new milk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Carefully lowered from its height , the full - freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then remounting aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Towards the end , Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder , and deeper and deeper into the Tun , until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether it was that Tashtego , that wild Indian , was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one - handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy ; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so , without stating his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up -- my God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="poor Tashtego -- like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well , dropped head - foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily gurgling , went clean out of sight !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Man overboard !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Daggoo , who amid the general consternation first came to his senses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Swing the bucket this way !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand - hold on the whip itself , the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , there was a terrible tumult ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Looking over the side , they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At this instant , while Daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip -- which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles -- a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The one remaining hook , upon which the entire strain now depended , seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way ; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Come down , come down !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="yelled the seamen to Daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In heaven ' s name , man ,&quot; cried Stubb , &quot; are you ramming home a cartridge there ?-- Avast !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How will that help him ; jamming that iron - bound bucket on top of his head ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Avast , will ye !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stand clear of the tackle !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Almost in the same instant , with a thunder - boom , the enormous mass dropped into the sea , like Niagara ' s Table - Rock into the whirlpool ; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it , to far down her glittering copper ; and all caught their breath , as half swinging -- now over the sailors ' heads , and now over the water -- Daggoo , through a thick mist of spray , was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles , while poor , buried - alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away , when a naked figure with a boarding - sword in his hand , was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The next , a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One packed rush was made to the side , and every eye counted every ripple , as moment followed moment , and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside , and pushed a little off from the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ha !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Daggoo , all at once , from his now quiet , swinging perch overhead ; and looking further off from the side , we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves ; a sight strange to see , as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Both !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="both !-- it is both !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout ; and soon after , Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand , and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Drawn into the waiting boat , they were quickly brought to the deck ; but Tashtego was long in coming to , and Queequeg did not look very brisk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , how had this noble rescue been accomplished ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why , diving after the slowly descending head , Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom , so as to scuttle a large hole there ; then dropping his sword , had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards , and so hauled out poor Tash by the head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He averred , that upon first thrusting in for him , a leg was presented ; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be , and might occasion great trouble ;-- he had thrust back the leg , and by a dexterous heave and toss , had wrought a somerset upon the Indian ; so that with the next trial , he came forth in the good old way -- head foremost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for the great head itself , that was doing as well as could be expected ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus , through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg , the deliverance , or rather , delivery of Tashtego , was successfully accomplished , in the teeth , too , of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments ; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing , riding and rowing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know that this queer adventure of the Gay - Header ' s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen , though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one ' s falling into a cistern ashore ; an accident which not seldom happens , and with much less reason too than the Indian ' s , considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale ' s well ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , peradventure , it may be sagaciously urged , how is this ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We thought the tissued , infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale , was the lightest and most corky part about him ; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We have thee there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not at all , but I have ye ; for at the time poor Tash fell in , the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents , leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well -- a double welded , hammered substance , as I have before said , much heavier than the sea water , and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it , so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed , affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run , as you may say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , it was a running delivery , so it was ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , had Tashtego perished in that head , it had been a very precious perishing ; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti ; coffined , hearsed , and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled -- the delicious death of an Ohio honey - hunter , who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree , found such exceeding store of it , that leaning too far over , it sucked him in , so that he died embalmed ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Prairie ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To scan the lines of his face , or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan ; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar , or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still , in that famous work of his , Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men , but also attentively studies the faces of horses , birds , serpents , and fish ; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therefore , though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer , in the application of these two semi - sciences to the whale , I will do my endeavor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I try all things ; I achieve what I can ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Physiognomically regarded , the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He has no proper nose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open - work belfry of the nose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dash the nose from Phidias ' s marble Jove , and what a sorry remainder !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude , all his proportions are so stately , that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous , in him is no blemish at all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nay , it is an added grandeur ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A nose to the whale would have been impertinent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly - boat , your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A pestilent conceit , which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In some particulars , perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale , is that of the full front of his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This aspect is sublime ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In thought , a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the repose of the pasture , the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles , the elephant ' s brow is majestic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Human or animal , the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It signifies --&quot; God : done this day by my hand .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in most creatures , nay in man himself , very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare ' s or Melancthon ' s rise so high , and descend so low , that the eyes themselves seem clear , eternal , tideless mountain lakes ; and all above them in the forehead ' s wrinkles , you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink , as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in the great Sperm Whale , this high and mighty god - like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified , that gazing on it , in that full front view , you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For you see no one point precisely ; not one distinct feature is revealed ; no nose , eyes , ears , or mouth ; no face ; he has none , proper ; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead , pleated with riddles ; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats , and ships , and men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , in profile , does this wondrous brow diminish ; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In profile , you plainly perceive that horizontal , semi - crescentic depression in the forehead ' s middle , which , in man , is Lavater ' s mark of genius ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But how ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Genius in the Sperm Whale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book , spoken a speech ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World , he would have been deified by their child - magian thoughts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They deified the crocodile of the Nile , because the crocodile is tongueless ; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue , or at least it is so exceedingly small , as to be incapable of protrusion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If hereafter any highly cultured , poetical nation shall lure back to their birth - right , the merry May - day gods of old ; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky ; in the now unhaunted hill ; then be sure , exalted to Jove ' s high seat , the great Sperm Whale shall lord it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man ' s and every being ' s face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Physiognomy , like every other human science , is but a passing fable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If then , Sir William Jones , who read in thirty languages , could not read the simplest peasant ' s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings , how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale ' s brow ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I but put that brow before you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Read it if you can ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 80" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Nut ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx , to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the full - grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in life -- as we have elsewhere seen -- this inclined plane is angularly filled up , and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass ; while under the long floor of this crater -- in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth -- reposes the mere handful of this monster ' s brain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life ; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks , like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So like a choice casket is it secreted in him , that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic - yards of his sperm magazine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lying in strange folds , courses , and convolutions , to their apprehensions , it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is plain , then , that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan , in the creature ' s living intact state , is an entire delusion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for his true brain , you can then see no indications of it , nor feel any ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whale , like all things that are mighty , wears a false brow to the common world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end , which is the high end , you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull , beheld in the same situation , and from the same point of view ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Indeed , place this reversed skull ( scaled down to the human magnitude ) among a plate of men ' s skulls , and you would involuntarily confound it with them ; and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit , in phrenological phrase you would say -- This man had no self - esteem , and no veneration ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And by those negations , considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the truest , though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale ' s proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then I have another idea for you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you attentively regard almost any quadruped ' s spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls , all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a German conceit , that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the curious external resemblance , I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying , in a sort of basso - relievo , the beaked prow of his canoe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For I believe that much of a man ' s character will be found betokened in his backbone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I would rather feel your spine than your skull , whoever you are ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I rejoice in my spine , as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck - vertebra ; and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across , being eight in height , and of a triangular figure with the base downwards ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size , but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , of course , this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance -- the spinal cord -- as the brain ; and directly communicates with the brain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what is still more , for many feet after emerging from the brain ' s cavity , the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth , almost equal to that of the brain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Under all these circumstances , would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale ' s spine phrenologically ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , viewed in this light , the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists , I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment , in reference to the Sperm Whale ' s hump ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This august hump , if I mistake not , rises over one of the larger vertebrae , and is , therefore , in some sort , the outer convex mould of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From its relative situation then , I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And that the great monster is indomitable , you will yet have reason to know ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 81" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pequod Meets The Virgin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The predestinated day arrived , and we duly met the ship Jungfrau , Derick De Deer , master , of Bremen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At one time the greatest whaling people in the world , the Dutch and Germans are now among the least ; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude , you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For some reason , the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While yet some distance from the Pequod , she rounded to , and dropping a boat , her captain was impelled towards us , impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What has he in his hand there ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck , pointing to something wavingly held by the German ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Impossible !-- a lamp - feeder !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Not that ,&quot; said Stubb , &quot; no , no , it ' s a coffee - pot , Mr . Starbuck ; he ' s coming off to make us our coffee , is the Yarman ; don ' t you see that big tin can there alongside of him ?-- that ' s his boiling water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he ' s all right , is the Yarman .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Go along with you ,&quot; cried Flask , &quot; it ' s a lamp - feeder and an oil - can ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ' s out of oil , and has come a - begging .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However curious it may seem for an oil - ship to be borrowing oil on the whale - ground , and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle , yet sometimes such a thing really happens ; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp - feeder as Flask did declare ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As he mounted the deck , Ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp - feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of Bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying - fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one ( that is , an empty one ), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His necessities supplied , Derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship ' s side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast - heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was Derick , that without pausing to put his oil - can and lamp - feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp - feeders ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the game having risen to leeward , he and the other three German boats that soon followed him , had considerably the start of the Pequod ' s keels ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There were eight whales , an average pod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aware of their danger , they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind , rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They left a great , wide wake , as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Full in this rapid wake , and many fathoms in the rear , swam a huge , humped old bull , which by his comparatively slow progress , as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him , seemed afflicted with the jaundice , or some other infirmity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance , seemed questionable ; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , he stuck to their wake , though indeed their back water must have retarded him , because the white - bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one , like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His spout was short , slow , and laborious ; coming forth with a choking sort of gush , and spending itself in torn shreds , followed by strange subterranean commotions in him , which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity , causing the waters behind him to upbubble ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Who ' s got some paregoric ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Stubb , &quot; he has the stomach - ache , I ' m afraid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lord , think of having half an acre of stomach - ache !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him , boys ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern ; but look , did ever whale yaw so before ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="it must be , he ' s lost his tiller .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses , careens , buries , rolls , and wallows on her way ; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk , and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib - ends , expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether he had lost that fin in battle , or had been born without it , it were hard to say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Only wait a bit , old chap , and I ' ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm ,&quot; cried cruel Flask , pointing to the whale - line near him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mind he don ' t sling thee with it ,&quot; cried Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Give way , or the German will have him .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish , because not only was he the largest , and therefore the most valuable whale , but he was nearest to them , and the other whales were going with such great velocity , moreover , as almost to defy pursuit for the time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At this juncture the Pequod ' s keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered ; but from the great start he had had , Derick ' s boat still led the chase , though every moment neared by his foreign rivals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The only thing they feared , was , that from being already so nigh to his mark , he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for Derick , he seemed quite confident that this would be the case , and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp - feeder at the other boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The ungracious and ungrateful dog !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck ; &quot; he mocks and dares me with the very poor - box I filled for him not five minutes ago !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- then in his old intense whisper --&quot; Give way , greyhounds !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dog to it !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I tell ye what it is , men &quot;-- cried Stubb to his crew --&quot; it ' s against my religion to get mad ; but I ' d like to eat that villainous Yarman -- Pull -- won ' t ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do ye love brandy ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A hogshead of brandy , then , to the best man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come , why don ' t some of ye burst a blood - vessel ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who ' s that been dropping an anchor overboard -- we don ' t budge an inch -- we ' re becalmed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Halloo , here ' s grass growing in the boat ' s bottom -- and by the Lord , the mast there ' s budding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This won ' t do , boys ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look at that Yarman !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The short and long of it is , men , will ye spit fire or not ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="see the suds he makes !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Flask , dancing up and down --&quot; What a hump -- Oh , DO pile on the beef -- lays like a log !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="my lads , DO spring -- slap - jacks and quahogs for supper , you know , my lads -- baked clams and muffins -- oh , DO , DO , spring ,-- he ' s a hundred barreller -- don ' t lose him now -- don ' t oh , DON ' T !-- see that Yarman -- Oh , won ' t ye pull for your duff , my lads -- such a sog !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="such a sogger !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Don ' t ye love sperm ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There goes three thousand dollars , men !-- a bank !-- a whole bank !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The bank of England !-- Oh , DO , DO , DO !-- What ' s that Yarman about now ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp - feeder at the advancing boats , and also his oil - can ; perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals ' way , and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The unmannerly Dutch dogger !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pull now , men , like fifty thousand line - of - battle - ship loads of red - haired devils ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What d ' ye say , Tashtego ; are you the man to snap your spine in two - and - twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What d ' ye say ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I say , pull like god - dam ,&quot;-- cried the Indian ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fiercely , but evenly incited by the taunts of the German , the Pequod ' s three boats now began ranging almost abreast ; and , so disposed , momentarily neared him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In that fine , loose , chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey , the three mates stood up proudly , occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of , &quot; There she slides , now !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hurrah for the white - ash breeze !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Down with the Yarman !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sail over him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But so decided an original start had Derick had , that spite of all their gallantry , he would have proved the victor in this race , had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white - ash , and while , in consequence , Derick ' s boat was nigh to capsizing , and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage ;-- that was a good time for Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a shout , they took a mortal start forwards , and slantingly ranged up on the German ' s quarter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An instant more , and all four boats were diagonically in the whale ' s immediate wake , while stretching from them , on both sides , was the foaming swell that he made ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a terrific , most pitiable , and maddening sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whale was now going head out , and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet ; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now to this hand , now to that , he yawed in his faltering flight , and still at every billow that he broke , he spasmodically sank in the sea , or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air , vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the bird has a voice , and with plaintive cries will make known her fear ; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea , was chained up and enchanted in him ; he had no voice , save that choking respiration through his spiracle , and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable ; while still , in his amazing bulk , portcullis jaw , and omnipotent tail , there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod ' s boats the advantage , and rather than be thus foiled of his game , Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart , ere the last chance would for ever escape ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke , than all three tigers -- Queequeg , Tashtego , Daggoo -- instinctively sprang to their feet , and standing in a diagonal row , simultaneously pointed their barbs ; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer , their three Nantucket irons entered the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Blinding vapours of foam and white - fire !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The three boats , in the first fury of the whale ' s headlong rush , bumped the German ' s aside with such force , that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out , and sailed over by the three flying keels ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Don ' t be afraid , my butter - boxes ,&quot; cried Stubb , casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by ; &quot; ye ' ll be picked up presently -- all right -- I saw some sharks astern -- St . Bernard ' s dogs , you know -- relieve distressed travellers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hurrah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="this is the way to sail now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Every keel a sunbeam !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hurrah !-- Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain -- makes the wheel - spokes fly , boys , when you fasten to him that way ; and there ' s danger of being pitched out too , when you strike a hill ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hurrah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="this is the way a fellow feels when he ' s going to Davy Jones -- all a rush down an endless inclined plane !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hurrah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="this whale carries the everlasting mail !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the monster ' s run was a brief one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Giving a sudden gasp , he tumultuously sounded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a grating rush , the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them ; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines , that using all their dexterous might , they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on ; till at last -- owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead - lined chocks of the boats , whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue -- the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water , while the three sterns tilted high in the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And the whale soon ceasing to sound , for some time they remained in that attitude , fearful of expending more line , though the position was a little ticklish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way , yet it is this &quot; holding on ,&quot; as it is called ; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back ; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing , it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best ; for it is but reasonable to presume , that the longer the stricken whale stays under water , the more he is exhausted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because , owing to the enormous surface of him -- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet -- the pressure of the water is immense ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under ; even here , above - ground , in the air ; how vast , then , the burden of a whale , bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line - of - battle ships , with all their guns , and stores , and men on board ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea , gazing down into its eternal blue noon ; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort , nay , not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths ; what landsman would have thought , that beneath all that silence and placidity , the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Suspended ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and to what ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To three bits of board ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said --&quot; Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="or his head with fish - spears ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold , the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon : he esteemeth iron as straw ; the arrow cannot make him flee ; darts are counted as stubble ; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This the creature ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="this he ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that unfulfilments should follow the prophets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail , Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea , to hide him from the Pequod ' s fish - spears !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In that sloping afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes ' army ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stand by , men ; he stirs ,&quot; cried Starbuck , as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water , distinctly conducting upwards to them , as by magnetic wires , the life and death throbs of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The next moment , relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards , as a small icefield will , when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Haul in !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Haul in !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck again ; &quot; he ' s rising .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand ' s breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship ' s lengths of the hunters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In most land animals there are certain valves or flood - gates in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non - valvular structure of the blood - vessels , so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him , and so distant and numerous its interior fountains , that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period ; even as in a drought a river will flow , whose source is in the well - springs of far - off and undiscernible hills ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and perilously drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout - hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted moisture into the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From this last vent no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His life , as they significantly call it , was untouched ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the boats now more closely surrounded him , the whole upper part of his form , with much of it that is ordinarily submerged , was plainly revealed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot - holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate , so from the points which the whale ' s eyes had once occupied , now protruded blind bulbs , horribly pitiable to see ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But pity there was none ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For all his old age , and his one arm , and his blind eyes , he must die the death and be murdered , in order to light the gay bridals and other merry - makings of men , and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still rolling in his blood , at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance , the size of a bushel , low down on the flank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; A nice spot ,&quot; cried Flask ; &quot; just let me prick him there once .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Avast !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck , &quot; there ' s no need of that !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But humane Starbuck was too late ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound , and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish , the whale now spouting thick blood , with swift fury blindly darted at the craft , bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore , capsizing Flask ' s boat and marring the bows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was his death stroke ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , by this time , so spent was he by loss of blood , that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made ; lay panting on his side , impotently flapped with his stumped fin , then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world ; turned up the white secrets of his belly ; lay like a log , and died ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was most piteous , that last expiring spout ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain , and with half - stifled melancholy gurglings the spray - column lowers and lowers to the ground -- so the last long dying spout of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon , while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship , the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Immediately , by Starbuck ' s orders , lines were secured to it at different points , so that ere long every boat was a buoy ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was transferred to her side , and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke - chains , for it was plain that unless artificially upheld , the body would at once sink to the bottom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly healed around them , and no prominence of any kind to denote their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But still more curious was the fact of a lance - head of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who had darted that stone lance ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It might have been darted by some Nor ' West Indian long before America was discovered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries , by the ship ' s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body ' s immensely increasing tendency to sink ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , Starbuck , who had the ordering of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been capsized , if still persisting in locking arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the immovable strain upon the timber - heads to which the fluke - chains and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship groaned and gasped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places , by the unnatural dislocation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke - chains , to pry them adrift from the timberheads ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached , while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hold on , hold on , won ' t ye ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb to the body , &quot; don ' t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By thunder , men , we must do something or go for it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No use prying there ; avast , I say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen - knife , and cut the big chains .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Knife ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , aye ,&quot; cried Queequeg , and seizing the carpenter ' s heavy hatchet , he leaned out of a porthole , and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke - chains ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But a few strokes , full of sparks , were given , when the exceeding strain effected the rest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a terrific snap , every fastening went adrift ; the ship righted , the carcase sank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If the only whales that thus sank were old , meagre , and broken - hearted creatures , their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic ; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking , consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it is not so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For young whales , in the highest health , and swelling with noble aspirations , prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life , with all their panting lard about them ; even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be it said , however , that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where one of that sort go down , twenty Right Whales do ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale ; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there are instances where , after the lapse of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the reason of this is obvious ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gases are generated in him ; he swells to a prodigious magnitude ; becomes a sort of animal balloon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A line - of - battle ship could hardly keep him under then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the Shore Whaling , on soundings , among the Bays of New Zealand , when a Right Whale gives token of sinking , they fasten buoys to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod ' s mast - heads , announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats ; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin - Back , belonging to the species of uncapturable whales , because of its incredible power of swimming ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , the Fin - Back ' s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale ' s , that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Virgin crowding all sail , made after her four young keels , and thus they all disappeared far to leeward , still in bold , hopeful chase ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="many are the Fin - Backs , and many are the Dericks , my friend ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 82" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Honour and Glory of Whaling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The more I dive into this matter of whaling , and push my researches up to the very spring - head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity ; and especially when I find so many great demi - gods and heroes , prophets of all sorts , who one way or other have shed distinction upon it , I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong , though but subordinately , to so emblazoned a fraternity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The gallant Perseus , a son of Jupiter , was the first whaleman ; and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said , that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Those were the knightly days of our profession , when we only bore arms to succor the distressed , and not to fill men ' s lamp - feeders ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda ; how the lovely Andromeda , the daughter of a king , was tied to a rock on the sea - coast , and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off , Perseus , the prince of whalemen , intrepidly advancing , harpooned the monster , and delivered and married the maid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was an admirable artistic exploit , rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day ; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And let no man doubt this Arkite story ; for in the ancient Joppa , now Jaffa , on the Syrian coast , in one of the Pagan temples , there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale , which the city ' s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the Romans took Joppa , the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story , is this : it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda -- indeed , by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it -- is that famous story of St . George and the Dragon ; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale ; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together , and often stand for each other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou art as a lion of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea ,&quot; saith Ezekiel ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some versions of the Bible use that word itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St . George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Any man may kill a snake , but only a Perseus , a St . George , a Coffin , have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us ; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin - like shape , and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback , yet considering the great ignorance of those times , when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists ; and considering that as in Perseus ' case , St . George ' s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach ; and considering that the animal ridden by St . George might have been only a large seal , or sea - horse ; bearing all this in mind , it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene , to hold this so - called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , placed before the strict and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the Philistines , Dagon by name ; who being planted before the ark of Israel , his horse ' s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , then , one of our own noble stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of England ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St . George ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And therefore , let not the knights of that honourable company ( none of whom , I venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron ), let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St . George ' s decoration than they ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether to admit Hercules among us or not , concerning this I long remained dubious : for though according to the Greek mythologies , that antique Crockett and Kit Carson -- that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be mooted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I claim him for one of our clan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , by the best contradictory authorities , this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale ; and vice versa ; certainly they are very similar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If I claim the demigod then , why not the prophet ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor do heroes , saints , demigods , and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Our grand master is still to be named ; for like royal kings of old times , we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster , which gives us the dread Vishnoo , one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos ; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord ;-- Vishnoo , who , by the first of his ten earthly incarnations , has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When Brahma , or the God of Gods , saith the Shaster , resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions , he gave birth to Vishnoo , to preside over the work ; but the Vedas , or mystical books , whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation , and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects , these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters ; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale , and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths , rescued the sacred volumes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman , then ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Perseus , St . George , Hercules , Jonah , and Vishnoo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there ' s a member - roll for you !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What club but the whaleman ' s can head off like that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 83" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jonah Historically Regarded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans , who , standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times , equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale , and Arion and the dolphin ; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts , for all that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One old Sag - Harbor whaleman ' s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this :-- He had one of those quaint old - fashioned Bibles , embellished with curious , unscientific plates ; one of which represented Jonah ' s whale with two spouts in his head -- a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan ( the Right Whale , and the varieties of that order ), concerning which the fishermen have this saying , &quot; A penny roll would choke him &quot;; his swallow is so very small ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , to this , Bishop Jebb ' s anticipative answer is ready ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is not necessary , hints the Bishop , that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale ' s belly , but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For truly , the Right Whale ' s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist - tables , and comfortably seat all the players ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Possibly , too , Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth ; but , on second thoughts , the Right Whale is toothless ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Another reason which Sag - Harbor ( he went by that name ) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale ' s gastric juices ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this objection likewise falls to the ground , because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a DEAD whale -- even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents , and crawled into them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , it has been divined by other continental commentators , that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship , he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by , some vessel with a whale for a figure - head ; and , I would add , possibly called &quot; The Whale ,&quot; as some craft are nowadays christened the &quot; Shark ,&quot; the &quot; Gull ,&quot; the &quot; Eagle .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life - preserver -- an inflated bag of wind -- which the endangered prophet swam to , and so was saved from a watery doom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Poor Sag - Harbor , therefore , seems worsted all round ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he had still another reason for his want of faith ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was this , if I remember right : Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea , and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days ' journey of Nineveh , a city on the Tigris , very much more than three days ' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How is that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean , and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days , not to speak of the Tigris waters , near the site of Nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , this idea of Jonah ' s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz , its reputed discoverer , and so make modern history a liar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all these foolish arguments of old Sag - Harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason -- a thing still more reprehensible in him , seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and abominable , devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For by a Portuguese Catholic priest , this very idea of Jonah ' s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so it was ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , to this day , the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And some three centuries ago , an English traveller in old Harris ' s Voyages , speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah , in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Pitchpoling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To make them run easily and swiftly , the axles of carriages are anointed ; and for much the same purpose , some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat ; they grease the bottom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm , it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage ; considering that oil and water are hostile ; that oil is a sliding thing , and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat , and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared , took more than customary pains in that occupation ; crawling under its bottom , where it hung over the side , and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft ' s bald keel ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Towards noon whales were raised ; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them , they turned and fled with swift precipitancy ; a disordered flight , as of Cleopatra ' s barges from Actium ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , the boats pursued , and Stubb ' s was foremost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By great exertion , Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron ; but the stricken whale , without at all sounding , still continued his horizontal flight , with added fleetness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It became imperative to lance the flying whale , or be content to lose him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible , he swam so fast and furious ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What then remained ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities , the sleights of hand and countless subtleties , to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced , none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Small sword , or broad sword , in all its exercises boasts nothing like it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale ; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking , jerking boat , under extreme headway ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Steel and wood included , the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length ; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon , and also of a lighter material -- pine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is furnished with a small rope called a warp , of considerable length , by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But before going further , it is important to mention here , that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance , yet it is seldom done ; and when done , is still less frequently successful , on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance , which in effect become serious drawbacks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As a general thing , therefore , you must first get fast to a whale , before any pitchpoling comes into play ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look now at Stubb ; a man who from his humorous , deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies , was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look at him ; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat ; wrapt in fleecy foam , the towing whale is forty feet ahead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Handling the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest unobstructed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then holding the lance full before his waistband ' s middle , he levels it at the whale ; when , covering him with it , he steadily depresses the butt - end in his hand , thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm , fifteen feet in the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his chin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next moment with a rapid , nameless impulse , in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance , and quivers in the life spot of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; That drove the spigot out of him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Tis July ' s immortal Fourth ; all fountains must run wine today !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Would now , it were old Orleans whiskey , or old Ohio , or unspeakable old Monongahela !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , Tashtego , lad , I ' d have ye hold a canakin to the jet , and we ' d drink round it !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yea , verily , hearts alive , we ' d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout - hole there , and from that live punch - bowl quaff the living stuff .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Again and again to such gamesome talk , the dexterous dart is repeated , the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The agonized whale goes into his flurry ; the tow - line is slackened , and the pitchpoler dropping astern , folds his hands , and mutely watches the monster die ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 85" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Fountain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That for six thousand years -- and no one knows how many millions of ages before -- the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep , as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these sprinklings and spoutings -- that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute ( fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o ' clock P . M . of this sixteenth day of December , A . D . 1851 ), it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapour -- this is surely a noteworthy thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let us , then , look at this matter , along with some interesting items contingent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being ' s , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the Sperm Whale ' s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If I say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle , I do not think I shall err ; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Assume it , and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath , he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That is to say , he would then live without breathing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Anomalous as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who systematically lives , by intervals , his full hour and more ( when at the bottom ) without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air ; for , remember , he has no gills ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How is this ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli - like vessels , which vessels , when he quits the surface , are completely distended with oxygenated blood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that for an hour or more , a thousand fathoms in the sea , he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him , just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable ; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true , seems the more cogent to me , when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT , as the fishermen phrase it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This is what I mean ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If unmolested , upon rising to the surface , the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Say he stays eleven minutes , and jets seventy times , that is , respires seventy breaths ; then whenever he rises again , he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again , to a minute ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him , so that he sounds , he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And not till those seventy breaths are told , will he finally go down to stay out his full term below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Remark , however , that in different individuals these rates are different ; but in any one they are alike ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air , ere descending for good ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How obvious is it , too , that this necessity for the whale ' s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not so much thy skill , then , O hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In man , breathing is incessantly going on -- one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout - hole ; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him ; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout - hole ; and being so clogged with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of smelling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But owing to the mystery of the spout -- whether it be water or whether it be vapour -- no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sure it is , nevertheless , that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what does he want of them ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No roses , no violets , no Cologne - water in the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Furthermore , as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal , and as that long canal -- like the grand Erie Canal -- is furnished with a sort of locks ( that open and shut ) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water , therefore the whale has no voice ; unless you insult him by saying , that when he so strangely rumbles , he talks through his nose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But then again , what has the whale to say ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this world , unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="happy that the world is such an excellent listener !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale , chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air , and for several feet laid along , horizontally , just beneath the upper surface of his head , and a little to one side ; this curious canal is very much like a gas - pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the question returns whether this gas - pipe is also a water - pipe ; in other words , whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath , or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and discharged through the spiracle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal ; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be , when in feeding he accidentally takes in water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the Sperm Whale ' s food is far beneath the surface , and there he cannot spout even if he would ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , if you regard him very closely , and time him with your watch , you will find that when unmolested , there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Speak out !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You have seen him spout ; then declare what the spout is ; can you not tell water from air ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My dear sir , in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as for this whale spout , you might almost stand in it , and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water cascading all around him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout , how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour ; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout - hole fissure , which is countersunk into the summit of the whale ' s head ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid - day sea in a calm , with his elevated hump sun - dried as a dromedary ' s in the desert ; even then , the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head , as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It will not do for him to be peering into it , and putting his face in it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it , and bring it away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For even when coming into slight contact with the outer , vapoury shreds of the jet , which will often happen , your skin will feverishly smart , from the acridness of the thing so touching it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I know one , who coming into still closer contact with the spout , whether with some scientific object in view , or otherwise , I cannot say , the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherefore , among whalemen , the spout is deemed poisonous ; they try to evade it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Another thing ; I have heard it said , and I do not much doubt it , that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes , it will blind you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The wisest thing the investigator can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still , we can hypothesize , even if we cannot prove and establish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My hypothesis is this : that the spout is nothing but mist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And besides other reasons , to this conclusion I am impelled , by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale ; I account him no common , shallow being , inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings , or near shores ; all other whales sometimes are ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He is both ponderous and profound ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings , such as Plato , Pyrrho , the Devil , Jupiter , Dante , and so on , there always goes up a certain semi - visible steam , while in the act of thinking deep thoughts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While composing a little treatise on Eternity , I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me ; and ere long saw reflected there , a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The invariable moisture of my hair , while plunged in deep thought , after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic , of an August noon ; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty , misty monster , to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea ; his vast , mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour , engendered by his incommunicable contemplations , and that vapour -- as you will sometimes see it -- glorified by a rainbow , as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , d ' ye see , rainbows do not visit the clear air ; they only irradiate vapour ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so , through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind , divine intuitions now and then shoot , enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And for this I thank God ; for all have doubts ; many deny ; but doubts or denials , few along with them , have intuitions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Doubts of all things earthly , and intuitions of some things heavenly ; this combination makes neither believer nor infidel , but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 86" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Tail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope , and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights ; less celestial , I celebrate a tail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale ' s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man , it comprises upon its upper surface alone , an area of at least fifty square feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The compact round body of its root expands into two broad , firm , flat palms or flukes , gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the crotch or junction , these flukes slightly overlap , then sideways recede from each other like wings , leaving a wide vacancy between ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale , the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews ; but cut into it , and you find that three distinct strata compose it :-- upper , middle , and lower ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The fibres in the upper and lower layers , are long and horizontal ; those of the middle one , very short , and running crosswise between the outside layers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This triune structure , as much as anything else , imparts power to the tail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To the student of old Roman walls , the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique , and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough , the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments , which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes , insensibly blend with them , and largely contribute to their might ; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Could annihilation occur to matter , this were the thing to do it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor does this -- its amazing strength , at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions ; where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of power ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the contrary , those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony , but it often bestows it ; and in everything imposingly beautiful , strength has much to do with the magic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules , and its charm would be gone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe , he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man , that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form , mark what robustness is there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son , the soft , curled , hermaphroditical Italian pictures , in which his idea has been most successfully embodied ; these pictures , so destitute as they are of all brawniness , hint nothing of any power , but the mere negative , feminine one of submission and endurance , which on all hands it is conceded , form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of , that whether wielded in sport , or in earnest , or in anger , whatever be the mood it be in , its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Therein no fairy ' s arm can transcend it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Five great motions are peculiar to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First , when used as a fin for progression ; Second , when used as a mace in battle ; Third , in sweeping ; Fourth , in lobtailing ; Fifth , in peaking flukes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : Being horizontal in its position , the Leviathan ' s tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It never wriggles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In man or fish , wriggling is a sign of inferiority ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To the whale , his tail is the sole means of propulsion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Scroll - wise coiled forwards beneath the body , and then rapidly sprung backwards , it is this which gives that singular darting , leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His side - fins only serve to steer by ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Second : It is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his conflicts with man , he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If it be made in the unobstructed air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No ribs of man or boat can withstand it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Your only salvation lies in eluding it ; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water , then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat , and the elasticity of its materials , a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two , a sort of stitch in the side , is generally the most serious result ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child ' s play ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some one strips off a frock , and the hole is stopped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Third : I cannot demonstrate it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant ' s trunk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping , when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea ; and if he feel but a sailor ' s whisker , woe to that sailor , whiskers and all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had this tail any prehensile power , I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes ' elephant that so frequented the flower - market , and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels , and then caressed their zones ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On more accounts than one , a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail ; for I have heard of yet another elephant , that when wounded in the fight , curved round his trunk and extracted the dart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fourth : Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas , you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity , and kitten - like , he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But still you see his power in his play ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air ; then smiting the surface , the thunderous concussion resounds for miles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You would almost think a great gun had been discharged ; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity , you would think that that was the smoke from the touch - hole ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fifth : As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back , they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface ; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps , his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air , and so remain vibrating a moment , till they downwards shoot out of view ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Excepting the sublime BREACH -- somewhere else to be described -- this peaking of the whale ' s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So in dreams , have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in gazing at such scenes , it is all in all what mood you are in ; if in the Dantean , the devils will occur to you ; if in that of Isaiah , the archangels ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Standing at the mast - head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea , I once saw a large herd of whales in the east , all heading towards the sun , and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As it seemed to me at the time , such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld , even in Persia , the home of the fire worshippers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant , I then testified of the whale , pronouncing him the most devout of all beings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For according to King Juba , the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The chance comparison in this chapter , between the whale and the elephant , so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned , should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality , much less the creatures to which they respectively belong ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan , so , compared with Leviathan ' s tail , his trunk is but the stalk of a lily ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The most direful blow from the elephant ' s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan , compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale ' s ponderous flukes , which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air , very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous , inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant ; nevertheless , there are not wanting some points of curious similitude ; among these is the spout ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk , and then elevating it , jet it forth in a stream ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The more I consider this mighty tail , the more do I deplore my inability to express it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At times there are gestures in it , which , though they would well grace the hand of man , remain wholly inexplicable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In an extensive herd , so remarkable , occasionally , are these mystic gestures , that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free - Mason signs and symbols ; that the whale , indeed , by these methods intelligently conversed with the world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body , full of strangeness , and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dissect him how I may , then , I but go skin deep ; I know him not , and never will ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if I know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I cannot completely make out his back parts ; and hint what he will about his face , I say again he has no face ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Grand Armada ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca , extending south - eastward from the territories of Birmah , forms the most southerly point of all Asia ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra , Java , Bally , and Timor ; which , with many others , form a vast mole , or rampart , lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia , and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This rampart is pierced by several sally - ports for the convenience of ships and whales ; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the straits of Sunda , chiefly , vessels bound to China from the west , emerge into the China seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java ; and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands , buttressed by that bold green promontory , known to seamen as Java Head ; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire : and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices , and silks , and jewels , and gold , and ivory , with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched , it seems a significant provision of nature , that such treasures , by the very formation of the land , should at least bear the appearance , however ineffectual , of being guarded from the all - grasping western world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean , the Baltic , and the Propontis ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unlike the Danes , these Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top - sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind , which for centuries past , by night and by day , have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java , freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But while they freely waive a ceremonial like this , they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays , lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra , have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits , fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers , the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed ; yet , even at the present day , we occasionally hear of English and American vessels , which , in those waters , have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a fair , fresh wind , the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea , and thence , cruising northwards , over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale , sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands , and gain the far coast of Japan , in time for the great whaling season there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By these means , the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world , previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific ; where Ahab , though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit , firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick , in the sea he was most known to frequent ; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But how now ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="in this zoned quest , does Ahab touch no land ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="does his crew drink air ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Surely , he will stop for water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nay ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a long time , now , the circus - running sun has raced within his fiery ring , and needs no sustenance but what ' s in himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mark this , too , in the whaler ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff , to be transferred to foreign wharves ; the world - wandering whale - ship carries no cargo but herself and crew , their weapons and their wants ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She has a whole lake ' s contents bottled in her ample hold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She is ballasted with utilities ; not altogether with unusable pig - lead and kentledge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She carries years ' water in her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Clear old prime Nantucket water ; which , when three years afloat , the Nantucketer , in the Pacific , prefers to drink before the brackish fluid , but yesterday rafted off in casks , from the Peruvian or Indian streams ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hence it is , that , while other ships may have gone to China from New York , and back again , touching at a score of ports , the whale - ship , in all that interval , may not have sighted one grain of soil ; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come ; they would only answer --&quot; Well , boys , here ' s the ark !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java , in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda ; indeed , as most of the ground , roundabout , was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising ; therefore , as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head , the look - outs were repeatedly hailed , and admonished to keep wide awake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow , and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air , yet not a single jet was descried ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts , the ship had well nigh entered the straits , when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft , and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But here be it premised , that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans , the Sperm Whales , instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies , as in former times , are now frequently met with in extensive herds , sometimes embracing so great a multitude , that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans , may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds , you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together , without being greeted by a single spout ; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Broad on both bows , at the distance of some two or three miles , and forming a great semicircle , embracing one half of the level horizon , a continuous chain of whale - jets were up - playing and sparkling in the noon - day air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unlike the straight perpendicular twin - jets of the Right Whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward - slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seen from the Pequod ' s deck , then , as she would rise on a high hill of the sea , this host of vapoury spouts , individually curling up into the air , and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze , showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis , descried of a balmy autumnal morning , by some horseman on a height ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains , accelerate their march , all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear , and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain ; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits ; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle , and swimming on , in one solid , but still crescentic centre ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them ; the harpooneers handling their weapons , and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If the wind only held , little doubt had they , that chased through these Straits of Sunda , the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And who could tell whether , in that congregated caravan , Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming , like the worshipped white - elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So with stun - sail piled on stun - sail , we sailed along , driving these leviathans before us ; when , of a sudden , the voice of Tashtego was heard , loudly directing attention to something in our wake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Corresponding to the crescent in our van , we beheld another in our rear ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seemed formed of detached white vapours , rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales ; only they did not so completely come and go ; for they constantly hovered , without finally disappearing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Levelling his glass at this sight , Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot - hole , crying , &quot; Aloft there , and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails ;-- Malays , sir , and after us !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As if too long lurking behind the headlands , till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits , these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit , to make up for their over - cautious delay ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when the swift Pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit ,-- mere riding - whips and rowels to her , that they were ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As with glass under arm , Ahab to - and - fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above seemed his ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing , and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance , and beheld , how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end ; and not only that , but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses ;-- when all these conceits had passed through his brain , Ahab ' s brow was left gaunt and ribbed , like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it , without being able to drag the firm thing from its place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side , emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed abating their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale , become notified of the three keels that were after them ,-- though as yet a mile in their rear ,-- than they rallied again , and forming in close ranks and battalions , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets , moved on with redoubled velocity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stripped to our shirts and drawers , we sprang to the white - ash , and after several hours ' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is gallied ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless rout ; and like King Porus ' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander , they seemed going mad with consternation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles , and aimlessly swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely paralysed as it were , helplessly floated like water - logged dismantled ships on the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep , pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves , they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though banding together in tens of thousands , the lion - maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Witness , too , all human beings , how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre ' s pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush helter - skelter for the outlets , crowding , trampling , jamming , and remorselessly dashing each other to death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Best , therefore , withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us , for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though many of the whales , as has been said , were in violent motion , yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated , but collectively remained in one place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As is customary in those cases , the boats at once separated , each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In about three minutes ' time , Queequeg ' s harpoon was flung ; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces , and then running away with us like light , steered straight for the heart of the herd ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise unprecedented ; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal , you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As , blind and deaf , the whale plunged forward , as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea , on all sides menaced as we flew , by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice - isles in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not a bit daunted , Queequeg steered us manfully ; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance ; now edging away from that , whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead , while all the time , Starbuck stood up in the bows , lance in hand , pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts , for there was no time to make long ones ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor were the oarsmen quite idle , though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Out of the way , Commodore !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried one , to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to swamp us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hard down with your tail , there !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried a second to another , which , close to our gunwale , seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan - like extremity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the Nantucket Indians , called druggs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other ' s grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hence it is , that at times like these the drugg , comes into requisition ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Our boat was furnished with three of them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The first and second were successfully darted , and we saw the whales staggeringly running off , fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But upon flinging the third , in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block , it caught under one of the seats of the boat , and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the oarsman in the boat ' s bottom as the seat slid from under him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks , but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in , and so stopped the leaks for the time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged - harpoons , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale ' s way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful disorders seemed waning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways vanished ; then , with the tapering force of his parting momentum , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales , were heard but not felt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin - like surface , called a sleek , produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles , and saw successive pods of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like multiplied spans of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a Titanic circus - rider might easily have over - arched the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales , more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in ; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Keeping at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves ; the women and children of this routed host ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles , and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles , the entire area at this juncture , embraced by the whole multitude , must have contained at least two or three square miles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At any rate -- though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive -- spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I mention this circumstance , because , as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , unsophisticated , and every way innocent and inexperienced ; however it may have been , these smaller whales -- now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake -- evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence , or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like household dogs they came snuffling round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg patted their foreheads ; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance ; but fearful of the consequences , for the time refrained from darting it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface , another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , suspended in those watery vaults , floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The lake , as I have hinted , was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent ; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast , as if leading two different lives at the time ; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment , be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence ;-- even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us , but not at us , as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new - born sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Floating on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One of these little infants , that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old , might have measured some fourteen feet in length , and some six feet in girth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was a little frisky ; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule ; where , tail to head , and all ready for the final spring , the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar ' s bow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The delicate side - fins , and the palms of his flukes , still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby ' s ears newly arrived from foreign parts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Line !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="line !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Queequeg , looking over the gunwale ; &quot; him fast !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="him fast !-- Who line him !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who struck ?-- Two whale ; one big , one little !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ails ye , man ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look - e here ,&quot; said Queequeg , pointing down ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As when the stricken whale , that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope ; as , after deep sounding , he floats up again , and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air ; so now , Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan , by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase , this natural line , with the maternal end loose , becomes entangled with the hempen one , so that the cub is thereby trapped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* The sperm whale , as with all other species of the Leviathan , but unlike most other fish , breeds indifferently at all seasons ; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob :-- a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats , curiously situated , one on each side of the anus ; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter ' s lance , the mother ' s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The milk is very sweet and rich ; it has been tasted by man ; it might do well with strawberries ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When overflowing with mutual esteem , the whales salute MORE HOMINUM ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus , though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights , did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments ; yea , serenely revelled in dalliance and delight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But even so , amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being , do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm ; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me , deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , as we thus lay entranced , the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats , still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host ; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle , where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing to what at last met our eyes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert , to seek to hamstring him , as it were , by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail - tendon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is done by darting a short - handled cutting - spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A whale wounded ( as we afterwards learned ) in this part , but not effectually , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold , at the battle of Saratoga , carrying dismay wherever he went ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But agonizing as was the wound of this whale , and an appalling spectacle enough , any way ; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd , was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the harpoon - line that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting - spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon - line round his tail , the cutting - spade itself had worked loose from his flesh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that tormented to madness , he was now churning through the water , violently flailing with his flexible tail , and tossing the keen spade about him , wounding and murdering his own comrades ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First , the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little , and tumble against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar ; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell ; the submarine bridal - chambers and nurseries vanished ; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , the long calm was departing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A low advancing hum was soon heard ; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block - ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring , the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre , as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places ; Starbuck taking the stern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oars !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oars !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he intensely whispered , seizing the helm --&quot; gripe your oars , and clutch your souls , now !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My God , men , stand by !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shove him off , you Queequeg -- the whale there !-- prick him !-- hit him !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stand up -- stand up , and stay so !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Spring , men -- pull , men ; never mind their backs -- scrape them !-- scrape away !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks , leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After many similar hair - breadth escapes , we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles , but now crossed by random whales , all violently making for one centre ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg ' s hat , who , while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales , had his hat taken clean from his head by the air - eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement ; for having clumped together at last in one dense body , they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Further pursuit was useless ; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern , and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The waif is a pennoned pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fishery ,-- the more whales the less fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of all the drugged whales only one was captured ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The rest contrived to escape for the time , but only to be taken , as will hereafter be seen , by some other craft than the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 88" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Schools and Schoolmasters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales , and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , though such great bodies are at times encountered , yet , as must have been seen , even at the present day , small detached bands are occasionally observed , embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such bands are known as schools ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They generally are of two sorts ; those composed almost entirely of females , and those mustering none but young vigorous males , or bulls , as they are familiarly designated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In cavalier attendance upon the school of females , you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude , but not old ; who , upon any alarm , evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In truth , this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman , swimming about over the watery world , surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking ; because , while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions , the ladies , even at full growth , are not more than one - third of the bulk of an average - sized male ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They are comparatively delicate , indeed ; I dare say , not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , it cannot be denied , that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to EMBONPOINT ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like fashionables , they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season , having just returned , perhaps , from spending the summer in the Northern seas , and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile , they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there , and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When serenely advancing on one of these journeys , if any strange suspicious sights are seen , my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way , presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him , and chases him away !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="High times , indeed , if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss ; though do what the Bashaw will , he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed ; for , alas !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="all fish bed in common ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They fence with their long lower jaws , sometimes locking them together , and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters ,-- furrowed heads , broken teeth , scolloped fins ; and in some instances , wrenched and dislocated mouths ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem ' s lord , then is it very diverting to watch that lord ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile , still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario , like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Granting other whales to be in sight , the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks ; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength , and hence their unctuousness is small ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for the sons and the daughters they beget , why , those sons and daughters must take care of themselves ; at least , with only the maternal help ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named , my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery , however much for the bower ; and so , being a great traveller , he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world ; every baby an exotic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In good time , nevertheless , as the ardour of youth declines ; as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school , so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is therefore not in strict character , however admirably satirical , that after going to school himself , he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there , but the folly of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His title , schoolmaster , would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself , but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale , must have read the memoirs of Vidocq , and informed himself what sort of a country - schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days , and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years , is true of all aged Sperm Whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Almost universally , a lone whale -- as a solitary Leviathan is called -- proves an ancient one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like venerable moss - bearded Daniel Boone , he will have no one near him but Nature herself ; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters , and the best of wives she is , though she keeps so many moody secrets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The schools composing none but young and vigorous males , previously mentioned , offer a strong contrast to the harem schools ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For while those female whales are characteristically timid , the young males , or forty - barrel - bulls , as they call them , are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans , and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter ; excepting those wondrous grey - headed , grizzled whales , sometimes met , and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Forty - barrel - bull schools are larger than the harem schools ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like a mob of young collegians , they are full of fight , fun , and wickedness , tumbling round the world at such a reckless , rollicking rate , that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They soon relinquish this turbulence though , and when about three - fourths grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of settlements , that is , harems ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Say you strike a Forty - barrel - bull -- poor devil !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="all his comrades quit him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But strike a member of the harem school , and her companions swim around her with every token of concern , sometimes lingering so near her and so long , as themselves to fall a prey ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 89" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fast - Fish and Loose - Fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The allusion to the waif and waif - poles in the last chapter but one , necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company , a whale may be struck by one vessel , then escape , and be finally killed and captured by another vessel ; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies , all partaking of this one grand feature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For example ,-- after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and drifting far away to leeward , be retaken by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly tows it alongside , without risk of life or line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen , were there not some written or unwritten , universal , undisputed law applicable to all cases ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment , was that of Holland ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was decreed by the States - General in A . D . 1695 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian ' s Pandects and the By - laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People ' s Business ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes ; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne ' s forthing , or the barb of a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A Fast - Fish belongs to the party fast to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="II ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A Loose - Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it , which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First : What is a Fast - Fish ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Alive or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants ,-- a mast , an oar , a nine - inch cable , a telegraph wire , or a strand of cobweb , it is all the same ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These are scientific commentaries ; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks -- the Coke - upon - Littleton of the fist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="True , among the more upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases , where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But others are by no means so scrupulous ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale - trover litigated in England , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas ; and when indeed they ( the plaintiffs ) had succeeded in harpooning the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to forsake not only their lines , but their boat itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ultimately the defendants ( the crew of another ship ) came up with the whale , struck , killed , seized , and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when those defendants were remonstrated with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs ' teeth , and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mr . Erskine was counsel for the defendants ; Lord Ellenborough was the judge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the course of the defence , the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position , by alluding to a recent crim ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="con ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to bridle his wife ' s viciousness , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , repenting of that step , he instituted an action to recover possession of her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Erskine was on the other side ; and he then supported it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness , had at last abandoned her ; yet abandon her he did , so that she became a loose - fish ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re - harpooned her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman ' s property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned Judge in set terms decided , to wit ,-- That as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a Loose - Fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; ergo , the aforesaid articles were theirs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge , might possibly object to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted , and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case ; these two laws touching Fast - Fish and Loose - Fish , I say , will , on reflection , be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence ; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture , the Temple of the Law , like the Temple of the Philistines , has but two props to stand on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is it not a saying in every one ' s mouth , Possession is half of the law : that is , regardless of how the thing came into possession ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But often possession is the whole of the law ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="What to that apostolic lancer , Brother Jonathan , is Texas but a Fast - Fish ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And concerning all these , is not Possession the whole of the law ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if the doctrine of Fast - Fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred doctrine of Loose - Fish is still more widely so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That is internationally and universally applicable ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="BRACTON , L . 3 , C . 3 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Latin from the books of the Laws of England , which taken along with the context , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the King , as Honourary Grand Harpooneer , must have the head , and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A division which , in the whale , is much like halving an apple ; there is no intermediate remainder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in England ; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose - Fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car , specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the first place , in curious proof of the fact that the above - mentioned law is still in force , I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seems that some honest mariners of Dover , or Sandwich , or some one of the Cinque Ports , had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle , called a Lord Warden ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Holding the office directly from the crown , I believe , all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By some writers this office is called a sinecure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now when these poor sun - burnt mariners , bare - footed , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs , had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good L150 from the precious oil and bone ; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their cronies , upon the strength of their respective shares ; up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of Blackstone under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale ' s head , he says --&quot; Hands off !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="this fish , my masters , is a Fast - Fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I seize it as the Lord Warden ' s .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation -- so truly English -- knowing not what to say , fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round ; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But that did in nowise mend the matter , or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At length one of them , after long scratching about for his ideas , made bold to speak ," sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Please , sir , who is the Lord Warden ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The Duke .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It is his .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; We have been at great trouble , and peril , and some expense , and is all that to go to the Duke ' s benefit ; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It is his .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It is his .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I thought to relieve my old bed - ridden mother by part of my share of this whale .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It is his .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Won ' t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It is his .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a word , the whale was seized and sold , and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To which my Lord Duke in substance replied ( both letters were published ) that he had already done so , and received the money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he ( the reverend gentleman ) would decline meddling with other people ' s business ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is this the still militant old man , standing at the corners of the three kingdoms , on all hands coercing alms of beggars ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The law itself has already been set forth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Plowdon gives us the reason for it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Says Plowdon , the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen , &quot; because of its superior excellence .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But why should the King have the head , and the Queen the tail ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A reason for that , ye lawyers !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In his treatise on &quot; Queen - Gold ,&quot; or Queen - pinmoney , an old King ' s Bench author , one William Prynne , thus discourseth : &quot; Ye tail is ye Queen ' s , that ye Queen ' s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies ' bodices ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this same bone is not in the tail ; it is in the head , which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But is the Queen a mermaid , to be presented with a tail ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An allegorical meaning may lurk here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers -- the whale and the sturgeon ; both royal property under certain limitations , and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown ' s ordinary revenue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter ; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale , the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish , which , symbolically regarded , may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus there seems a reason in all things , even in law ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="SIR T . BROWNE , V . E ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted , and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy , vapoury , mid - day sea , that the many noses on the Pequod ' s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I will bet something now ,&quot; said Stubb , &quot; that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I thought they would keel up before long .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Presently , the vapours in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As we glided nearer , the stranger showed French colours from his peak ; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea - fowl that circled , and hovered , and swooped around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died unmolested on the sea , and so floated an unappropriated corpse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It may well be conceived , what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale ; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague , when the living are incompetent to bury the departed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of attar - of - rose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze , we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside ; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In truth , it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia , or indigestion ; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may shun blasted whales in general ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade - pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There ' s a pretty fellow , now ,&quot; he banteringly laughed , standing in the ship ' s bows , &quot; there ' s a jackal for ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles , and cases of snuffers , foreseeing that all the oil they will get won ' t be enough to dip the Captain ' s wick into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here ' s a Crappo that is content with our leavings , the drugged whale there , I mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Poor devil !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say , pass round a hat , some one , and let ' s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity ' s sake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For what oil he ' ll get from that drugged whale there , wouldn ' t be fit to burn in a jail ; no , not in a condemned cell ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as for the other whale , why , I ' ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he ' ll get from that bundle of bones ; though , now that I think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I wonder now if our old man has thought of that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s worth trying ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , I ' m for it ;&quot; and so saying he started for the quarter - deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell , with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Issuing from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat ' s crew , and pulled off for the stranger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Drawing across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste , the upper part of her stem - piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk , was painted green , and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there ; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon her head boards , in large gilt letters , he read &quot; Bouton de Rose ,&quot;-- Rose - button , or Rose - bud ; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription , yet the word ROSE , and the bulbous figure - head put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; A wooden rose - bud , eh ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he cried with his hand to his nose , &quot; that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck , he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side , and thus come close to the blasted whale ; and so talk over it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Arrived then at this spot , with one hand still to his nose , he bawled --&quot; Bouton - de - Rose , ahoy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="are there any of you Bouton - de - Roses that speak English ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes ,&quot; rejoined a Guernsey - man from the bulwarks , who turned out to be the chief - mate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , then , my Bouton - de - Rose - bud , have you seen the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; WHAT whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The WHITE Whale -- a Sperm Whale -- Moby Dick , have ye seen him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Never heard of such a whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Cachalot Blanche !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="White Whale -- no .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Very good , then ; good bye now , and I ' ll call again in a minute .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod , and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter - deck rail awaiting his report , he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted --&quot; No , Sir !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon which Ahab retired , and Stubb returned to the Frenchman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He now perceived that the Guernsey - man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting - spade , had slung his nose in a sort of bag ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s the matter with your nose , there ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Broke it ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I wish it was broken , or that I didn ' t have any nose at all !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="answered the Guernsey - man , who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But what are you holding YOURS for ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , nothing !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It ' s a wax nose ; I have to hold it on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fine day , ain ' t it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Air rather gardenny , I should say ; throw us a bunch of posies , will ye , Bouton - de - Rose ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What in the devil ' s name do you want here ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="roared the Guernseyman , flying into a sudden passion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="keep cool -- cool ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="yes , that ' s the word !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="why don ' t you pack those whales in ice while you ' re working at ' em ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But joking aside , though ; do you know , Rose - bud , that it ' s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for that dried up one , there , he hasn ' t a gill in his whole carcase .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I know that well enough ; but , d ' ye see , the Captain here won ' t believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a Cologne manufacturer before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But come aboard , and mayhap he ' ll believe you , if he won ' t me ; and so I ' ll get out of this dirty scrape .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Anything to oblige ye , my sweet and pleasant fellow ,&quot; rejoined Stubb , and with that he soon mounted to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There a queer scene presented itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sailors , in tasselled caps of red worsted , were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But they worked rather slow and talked very fast , and seemed in anything but a good humor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib - booms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now and then pairs of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast - head to get some fresh air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some thinking they would catch the plague , dipped oakum in coal - tar , and at intervals held it to their nostrils ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl , were vigorously puffing tobacco - smoke , so that it constantly filled their olfactories ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the Captain ' s round - house abaft ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held ajar from within ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day , had betaken himself to the Captain ' s round - house ( CABINET he called it ) to avoid the pest ; but still , could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Marking all this , Stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the Guernsey - man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sounding him carefully , Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey - man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him , so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain , without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="According to this little plan of theirs , the Guernsey - man , under cover of an interpreter ' s office , was to tell the Captain what he pleased , but as coming from Stubb ; and as for Stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a sea - captain , with large whiskers and moustache , however ; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch - seals at his side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To this gentleman , Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey - man , who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What shall I say to him first ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said he ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why ,&quot; said Stubb , eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals , &quot; you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me , though I don ' t pretend to be a judge .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He says , Monsieur ,&quot; said the Guernsey - man , in French , turning to his captain , &quot; that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel , whose captain and chief - mate , with six sailors , had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What now ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said the Guernsey - man to Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why , since he takes it so easy , tell him that now I have eyed him carefully , I ' m quite certain that he ' s no more fit to command a whale - ship than a St . Jago monkey ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , tell him from me he ' s a baboon .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He vows and declares , Monsieur , that the other whale , the dried one , is far more deadly than the blasted one ; in fine , Monsieur , he conjures us , as we value our lives , to cut loose from these fish .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting - tackles , and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What now ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said the Guernsey - man , when the Captain had returned to them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why , let me see ; yes , you may as well tell him now that -- that -- in fact , tell him I ' ve diddled him , and ( aside to himself ) perhaps somebody else .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He says , Monsieur , that he ' s very happy to have been of any service to us .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hearing this , the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties ( meaning himself and mate ) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He wants you to take a glass of wine with him ,&quot; said the interpreter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thank him heartily ; but tell him it ' s against my principles to drink with the man I ' ve diddled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In fact , tell him I must go .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He says , Monsieur , that his principles won ' t admit of his drinking ; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then Monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it ' s so calm they won ' t drift .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By this time Stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the Guernsey - man to this effect ,-- that having a long tow - line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship ' s side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While the Frenchman ' s boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow - line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Presently a breeze sprang up ; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the Frenchman soon increased his distance , while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb ' s whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seizing his sharp boat - spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His boat ' s crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as gold - hunters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And all the time numberless fowls were diving , and ducking , and screaming , and yelling , and fighting around them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb was beginning to look disappointed , especially as the horrible nosegay increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of perfume , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I have it , I have it ,&quot; cried Stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean regions , &quot; a purse !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a purse !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dropping his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap , or rich mottled old cheese ; very unctuous and savory withal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You might easily dent it with your thumb ; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some six handfuls were obtained ; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea , and still more , perhaps , might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab ' s loud command to Stubb to desist , and come on board , else the ship would bid them good bye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 92" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ambergris ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in 1791 a certain Nantucket - born Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise origin of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber , yet the two substances are quite distinct ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For amber , though at times found on the sea - coast , is also dug up in some far inland soils , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , amber is a hard , transparent , brittle , odorless substance , used for mouth - pieces to pipes , for beads and ornaments ; but ambergris is soft , waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in pastiles , precious candles , hair - powders , and pomatum ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Turks use it in cooking , and also carry it to Mecca , for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St . Peter ' s in Rome ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret , to flavor it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet so it is ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth ' s pills , and then running out of harm ' s way , as laborers do in blasting rocks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first Stubb thought might be sailors ' trowsers buttons ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay ; is this nothing ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bethink thee of that saying of St . Paul in Corinthians , about corruption and incorruption ; how that we are sown in dishonour , but raised in glory ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill - savor , Cologne - water , in its rudimental manufacturing stages , is the worst ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal , but cannot , owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen , and which , in the estimation of some already biased minds , might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman ' s two whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved , that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly , untidy business ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there is another thing to rebut ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They hint that all whales always smell bad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now how did this odious stigma originate ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I opine , that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London , more than two centuries ago ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because those whalemen did not then , and do not now , try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done ; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits , thrust it through the bung holes of large casks , and carry it home in that manner ; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas , and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed , forbidding any other course ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and unloading one of these whale cemeteries , in the Greenland dock , a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave - yard , for the foundations of a Lying - in - Hospital ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I partly surmise also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland , in former times , of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg , which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack , in his great work on Smells , a text - book on that subject ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As its name imports ( smeer , fat ; berg , to put up ), this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to Holland for that purpose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a collection of furnaces , fat - kettles , and oil sheds ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company , by the nose ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say , that the motion of a Sperm Whale ' s flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk - scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance , considering his magnitude ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Must it not be to that famous elephant , with jewelled tusks , and redolent with myrrh , which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander the Great ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 93" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Castaway ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod ' s crew ; an event most lamentable ; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some few hands are reserved called ship - keepers , whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As a general thing , these ship - keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats ' crews ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if there happen to be an unduly slender , clumsy , or timorous wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a ship - keeper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick - name , Pip by abbreviation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Poor Pip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy - jolly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In outer aspect , Pip and Dough - Boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar colour , driven in one eccentric span ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But while hapless Dough - Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects , Pip , though over tender - hearted , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer , freer relish than any other race ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For blacks , the year ' s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty - five Fourth of Julys and New Year ' s Days ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor smile so , while I write that this little black was brilliant , for even blackness has its brilliancy ; behold yon lustrous ebony , panelled in king ' s cabinets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Pip loved life , and all life ' s peaceable securities ; so that the panic - striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped , had most sadly blurred his brightness ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily subdued in him , in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires , that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut , he had once enlivened many a fiddler ' s frolic on the green ; and at melodious even - tide , with his gay ha - ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="had turned the round horizon into one star - belled tambourine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a blue - veined neck , the pure - watered diamond drop will healthful glow ; yet , when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural gases ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then come out those fiery effulgences , infernally superb ; then the evil - blazing diamond , once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some crown - jewel stolen from the King of Hell ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But let us to the story ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It came to pass , that in the ambergris affair Stubb ' s after - oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand , as for a time to become quite maimed ; and , temporarily , Pip was put into his place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The first time Stubb lowered with him , Pip evinced much nervousness ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably ; though Stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost , for he might often find it needful ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now upon the second lowering , the boat paddled upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary rap , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor Pip ' s seat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap , paddle in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest , he breasted it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last plumping into the water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and presto !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tashtego stood in the bows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was full of the fire of the hunt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He hated Pip for a poltroon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Snatching the boat - knife from its sheath , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards Stubb , exclaimed interrogatively , &quot; Cut ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime Pip ' s blue , choked face plainly looked , Do , for God ' s sake !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All passed in a flash ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In less than half a minute , this entire thing happened ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Damn him , cut !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="roared Stubb ; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate , Stubb then in a plain , business - like , but still half humorous manner , cursed Pip officially ; and that done , unofficially gave him much wholesome advice ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The substance was , Never jump from a boat , Pip , except -- but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , in general , STICK TO THE BOAT , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT , is still better ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover , as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command , &quot; Stick to the boat , Pip , or by the Lord , I won ' t pick you up if you jump ; mind that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We can ' t afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bear that in mind , and don ' t jump any more .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money - making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But we are all in the hands of the Gods ; and Pip jumped again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller ' s trunk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Alas !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb was but too true to his word ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a beautiful , bounteous , blue day ; the spangled sea calm and cool , and flatly stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like gold - beater ' s skin hammered out to the extremest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bobbing up and down in that sea , Pip ' s ebon head showed like a head of cloves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No boat - knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb ' s inexorable back was turned upon him ; and the whale was winged ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In three minutes , a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Out from the centre of the sea , poor Pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring - carriage ashore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="who can tell it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mark , how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea -- mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No ; he did not mean to , at least ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity , is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not unfrequently occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it so happened , that those boats , without seeing Pip , suddenly spying whales close to them on one side , turned , and gave chase ; and Stubb ' s boat was now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish , that Pip ' s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him ; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot ; such , at least , they said he was ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not drowned entirely , though ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes ; and the miser - merman , Wisdom , revealed his hoarded heaps ; and among the joyous , heartless , ever - juvenile eternities , Pip saw the multitudinous , God - omnipresent , coral insects , that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He saw God ' s foot upon the treadle of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So man ' s insanity is heaven ' s sense ; and wandering from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is absurd and frantic ; and weal or woe , feels then uncompromised , indifferent as his God ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the rest , blame not Stubb too hardly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The thing is common in that fishery ; and in the sequel of the narrative , it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 94" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A Squeeze of the Hand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That whale of Stubb ' s , so dearly purchased , was duly brought to the Pequod ' s side , where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed , were regularly gone through , even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun , or Case ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try - works , of which anon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree , that when , with several others , I sat down before a large Constantine ' s bath of it , I found it strangely concreted into lumps , here and there rolling about in the liquid part ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A sweet and unctuous duty !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such a clearer !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="such a sweetener !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="such a softener !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="such a delicious molifier !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After having my hands in it for only a few minutes , my fingers felt like eels , and began , as it were , to serpentine and spiralise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As I sat there at my ease , cross - legged on the deck ; after the bitter exertion at the windlass ; under a blue tranquil sky ; the ship under indolent sail , and gliding so serenely along ; as I bathed my hands among those soft , gentle globules of infiltrated tissues , woven almost within the hour ; as they richly broke to my fingers , and discharged all their opulence , like fully ripe grapes their wine ; as I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma ,-- literally and truly , like the smell of spring violets ; I declare to you , that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow ; I forgot all about our horrible oath ; in that inexpressible sperm , I washed my hands and my heart of it ; I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger ; while bathing in that bath , I felt divinely free from all ill - will , or petulance , or malice , of any sort whatsoever ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Squeeze !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="squeeze !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="squeeze !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="all the morning long ; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it ; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me ; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co - laborers ' hands in it , mistaking their hands for the gentle globules ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget ; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands , and looking up into their eyes sentimentally ; as much as to say ,-- Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social acerbities , or know the slightest ill - humor or envy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come ; let us squeeze hands all round ; nay , let us all squeeze ourselves into each other ; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For now , since by many prolonged , repeated experiences , I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower , or at least shift , his conceit of attainable felicity ; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy ; but in the wife , the heart , the bed , the table , the saddle , the fireside , the country ; now that I have perceived all this , I am ready to squeeze case eternally ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In thoughts of the visions of the night , I saw long rows of angels in paradise , each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , while discoursing of sperm , it behooves to speak of other things akin to it , in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try - works ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First comes white - horse , so called , which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish , and also from the thicker portions of his flukes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is tough with congealed tendons -- a wad of muscle -- but still contains some oil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After being severed from the whale , the white - horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Plum - pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale ' s flesh , here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber , and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a most refreshing , convivial , beautiful object to behold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As its name imports , it is of an exceedingly rich , mottled tint , with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground , dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is plums of rubies , in pictures of citron ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Spite of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I confess , that once I stole behind the foremast to try it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It tasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted , supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season , and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is called slobgollion ; an appellation original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is an ineffably oozy , stringy affair , most frequently found in the tubs of sperm , after a prolonged squeezing , and subsequent decanting ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I hold it to be the wondrously thin , ruptured membranes of the case , coalescing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gurry , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It designates the dark , glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale , and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nippers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale ' s vocabulary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as applied by whalemen , it becomes so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A whaleman ' s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan ' s tail : it averages an inch in thickness , and for the rest , is about the size of the iron part of a hoe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Edgewise moved along the oily deck , it operates like a leathern squilgee ; and by nameless blandishments , as of magic , allures along with it all impurities ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to learn all about these recondite matters , your best way is at once to descend into the blubber - room , and have a long talk with its inmates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket - pieces , when stript and hoisted from the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents , this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros , especially by night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On one side , lit by a dull lantern , a space has been left clear for the workmen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They generally go in pairs ,-- a pike - and - gaffman and a spade - man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whaling - pike is similar to a frigate ' s boarding - weapon of the same name ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The gaff is something like a boat - hook ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With his gaff , the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber , and strives to hold it from slipping , as the ship pitches and lurches about ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , the spade - man stands on the sheet itself , perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse - pieces ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This spade is sharp as hone can make it ; the spademan ' s feet are shoeless ; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him , like a sledge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If he cuts off one of his own toes , or one of his assistants ', would you be very much astonished ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Toes are scarce among veteran blubber - room men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 95" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Cassock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this post - mortemizing of the whale ; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass , pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange , enigmatical object , which you would have seen there , lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not the wondrous cistern in the whale ' s huge head ; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw ; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail ; none of these would so surprise you , as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone ,-- longer than a Kentuckian is tall , nigh a foot in diameter at the base , and jet - black as Yojo , the ebony idol of Queequeg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And an idol , indeed , it is ; or , rather , in old times , its likeness was ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea ; and for worshipping which , King Asa , her son , did depose her , and destroyed the idol , and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron , as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and assisted by two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Extending it upon the forecastle deck , he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt , as an African hunter the pelt of a boa ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This done he turns the pelt inside out , like a pantaloon leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its diameter ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to dry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two slits for arm - holes at the other end , he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Immemorial to all his order , this investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the peculiar functions of his office ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That office consists in mincing the horse - pieces of blubber for the pots ; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse , planted endwise against the bulwarks , and with a capacious tub beneath it , into which the minced pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a rapt orator ' s desk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Arrayed in decent black ; occupying a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on bible leaves ; what a candidate for an archbishopric , what a lad for a Pope were this mincer !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* Bible leaves !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bible leaves !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It enjoins him to be careful , and cut his work into as thin slices as possible , inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated , and its quantity considerably increased , besides perhaps improving it in quality ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 96" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Try - Works ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides her hoisted boats , an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try - works ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is as if from the open field a brick - kiln were transported to her planks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The try - works are planted between the foremast and mainmast , the most roomy part of the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The foundation does not penetrate the deck , but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides , and screwing it down to the timbers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the flanks it is cased with wood , and at top completely covered by a large , sloping , battened hatchway ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Removing this hatch we expose the great try - pots , two in number , and each of several barrels ' capacity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When not in use , they are kept remarkably clean ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand , till they shine within like silver punch - bowls ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="During the night - watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While employed in polishing them -- one man in each pot , side by side -- many confidential communications are carried on , over the iron lips ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was in the left hand try - pot of the Pequod , with the soapstone diligently circling round me , that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact , that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid , my soapstone for example , will descend from any point in precisely the same time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Removing the fire - board from the front of the try - works , the bare masonry of that side is exposed , penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces , directly underneath the pots ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck , by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By a tunnel inserted at the rear , this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are no external chimneys ; they open direct from the rear wall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And here let us go back for a moment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was about nine o ' clock at night that the Pequod ' s try - works were first started on this present voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; All ready there ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Off hatch , then , and start her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You cook , fire the works .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This was an easy thing , for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try - works has to be fed for a time with wood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After that no wood is used , except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a word , after being tried out , the crisp , shrivelled blubber , now called scraps or fritters , still contains considerable of its unctuous properties ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These fritters feed the flames ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like a plethoric burning martyr , or a self - consuming misanthrope , once ignited , the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Would that he consumed his own smoke !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="for his smoke is horrible to inhale , and inhale it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It has an unspeakable , wild , Hindoo odor about it , such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment ; it is an argument for the pit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By midnight the works were in full operation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We were clear from the carcase ; sail had been made ; the wind was freshening ; the wild ocean darkness was intense ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames , which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues , and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging , as with the famed Greek fire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The burning ship drove on , as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So the pitch and sulphur - freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote , Canaris , issuing from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the Turkish frigates , and folded them in conflagrations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The hatch , removed from the top of the works , now afforded a wide hearth in front of them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers , always the whale - ship ' s stokers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots , or stirred up the fires beneath , till the snaky flames darted , curling , out of the doors to catch them by the feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil , which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Opposite the mouth of the works , on the further side of the wide wooden hearth , was the windlass ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This served for a sea - sofa ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here lounged the watch , when not otherwise employed , looking into the red heat of the fire , till their eyes felt scorched in their heads ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Their tawny features , now all begrimed with smoke and sweat , their matted beards , and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth , all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures , their tales of terror told in words of mirth ; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them , like the flames from the furnace ; as to and fro , in their front , the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers ; as the wind howled on , and the sea leaped , and the ship groaned and dived , and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night , and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth , and viciously spat round her on all sides ; then the rushing Pequod , freighted with savages , and laden with fire , and burning a corpse , and plunging into that blackness of darkness , seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander ' s soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So seemed it to me , as I stood at her helm , and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire - ship on the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wrapped , for that interval , in darkness myself , I but the better saw the redness , the madness , the ghastliness of others ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me , capering half in smoke and half in fire , these at last begat kindred visions in my soul , so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But that night , in particular , a strange ( and ever since inexplicable ) thing occurred to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starting from a brief standing sleep , I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The jaw - bone tiller smote my side , which leaned against it ; in my ears was the low hum of sails , just beginning to shake in the wind ; I thought my eyes were open ; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , spite of all this , I could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card , by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom , now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Uppermost was the impression , that whatever swift , rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A stark , bewildered feeling , as of death , came over me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller , but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was , somehow , in some enchanted way , inverted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what is the matter with me ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thought I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="in my brief sleep I had turned myself about , and was fronting the ship ' s stern , with my back to her prow and the compass ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In an instant I faced back , just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind , and very probably capsizing her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night , and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look not too long in the face of the fire , O man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Never dream with thy hand on the helm !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Turn not thy back to the compass ; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller ; believe not the artificial fire , when its redness makes all things look ghastly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To - morrow , in the natural sun , the skies will be bright ; those who glared like devils in the forking flames , the morn will show in far other , at least gentler , relief ; the glorious , golden , glad sun , the only true lamp -- all others but liars !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia ' s Dismal Swamp , nor Rome ' s accursed Campagna , nor wide Sahara , nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Lamp ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Had you descended from the Pequod ' s try - works to the Pequod ' s forecastle , where the off duty watch were sleeping , for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults , each mariner a chiselled muteness ; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In merchantmen , oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To dress in the dark , and eat in the dark , and stumble in darkness to his pallet , this is his usual lot ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the whaleman , as he seeks the food of light , so he lives in light ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He makes his berth an Aladdin ' s lamp , and lays him down in it ; so that in the pitchiest night the ship ' s black hull still houses an illumination ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps -- often but old bottles and vials , though -- to the copper cooler at the try - works , and replenishes them there , as mugs of ale at a vat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He burns , too , the purest of oil , in its unmanufactured , and , therefore , unvitiated state ; a fluid unknown to solar , lunar , or astral contrivances ashore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is sweet as early grass butter in April ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He goes and hunts for his oil , so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness , even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 98" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stowing Down and Clearing Up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast - head ; how he is chased over the watery moors , and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep ; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded ; and how ( on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed ) his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner ; how , in due time , he is condemned to the pots , and , like Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , his spermaceti , oil , and bone pass unscathed through the fire ;-- but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing -- singing , if I may -- the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold , where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities , sliding along beneath the surface as before ; but , alas !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="never more to rise and blow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While still warm , the oil , like hot punch , is received into the six - barrel casks ; and while , perhaps , the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea , the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over , end for end , and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck , like so many land slides , till at last man - handled and stayed in their course ; and all round the hoops , rap , rap , go as many hammers as can play upon them , for now , EX OFFICIO , every sailor is a cooper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At length , when the last pint is casked , and all is cool , then the great hatchways are unsealed , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This done , the hatches are replaced , and hermetically closed , like a closet walled up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the sperm fishery , this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil ; on the sacred quarter - deck enormous masses of the whale ' s head are profanely piled ; great rusty casks lie about , as in a brewery yard ; the smoke from the try - works has besooted all the bulwarks ; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness ; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself ; while on all hands the din is deafening ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But a day or two after , you look about you , and prick your ears in this self - same ship ; and were it not for the tell - tale boats and try - works , you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel , with a most scrupulously neat commander ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale , a potent lye is readily made ; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side , that lye quickly exterminates it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hands go diligently along the bulwarks , and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The soot is brushed from the lower rigging ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try - works , completely hiding the pots ; every cask is out of sight ; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks ; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship ' s company , the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded , then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions ; shift themselves from top to toe ; and finally issue to the immaculate deck , fresh and all aglow , as bridegrooms new - leaped from out the daintiest Holland ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , with elated step , they pace the planks in twos and threes , and humorously discourse of parlors , sofas , carpets , and fine cambrics ; propose to mat the deck ; think of having hanging to the top ; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To hint to such musked mariners of oil , and bone , and blubber , were little short of audacity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They know not the thing you distantly allude to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Away , and bring us napkins !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But mark : aloft there , at the three mast heads , stand three men intent on spying out more whales , which , if caught , infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture , and drop at least one small grease - spot somewhere ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes ; and many is the time , when , after the severest uninterrupted labors , which know no night ; continuing straight through for ninety - six hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line ,-- they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and slash , yea , and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try - works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship , and make a spotless dairy room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks , are startled by the cry of &quot; There she blows !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="my friends , but this is man - killing !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet this is life ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world ' s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm ; and then , with weary patience , cleansed ourselves from its defilements , and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul ; hardly is this done , when -- THERE SHE BLOWS !-- the ghost is spouted up , and away we sail to fight some other world , and go through young life ' s old routine again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the metempsychosis !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pythagoras , that in bright Greece , two thousand years ago , did die , so good , so wise , so mild ; I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage -- and , foolish as I am , taught thee , a green simple boy , how to splice a rope !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 99" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Doubloon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter - deck , taking regular turns at either limit , the binnacle and mainmast ; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks , when most plunged in his mood , he was wont to pause in turn at each spot , and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When he halted before the binnacle , with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass , that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose ; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast , then , as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there , he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness , only dashed with a certain wild longing , if not hopefulness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But one morning , turning to pass the doubloon , he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it , as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And some certain significance lurks in all things , else all things are little worth , and the round world itself but an empty cipher , except to sell by the cartload , as they do hills about Boston , to fill up some morass in the Milky Way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now this doubloon was of purest , virgin gold , raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills , whence , east and west , over golden sands , the head - waters of many a Pactolus flows ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes , yet , untouchable and immaculate to any foulness , it still preserved its Quito glow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands , and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach , nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe - striking end ; and however wanton in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners revered it as the white whale ' s talisman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic token - pieces ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here palms , alpacas , and volcanoes ; sun ' s disks and stars ; ecliptics , horns - of - plenty , and rich banners waving , are in luxuriant profusion stamped ; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories , by passing through those fancy mints , so Spanishly poetic ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On its round border it bore the letters , REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR : QUITO ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world , and beneath the great equator , and named after it ; and it had been cast midway up the Andes , in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes ' summits ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ; on the third a crowing cock ; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac , the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics , and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Before this equatorial coin , Ahab , not unobserved by others , was now pausing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There ' s something ever egotistical in mountain - tops and towers , and all other grand and lofty things ; look here ,-- three peaks as proud as Lucifer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The firm tower , that is Ahab ; the volcano , that is Ahab ; the courageous , the undaunted , and victorious fowl , that , too , is Ahab ; all are Ahab ; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe , which , like a magician ' s glass , to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Great pains , small gains for those who ask the world to solve them ; it cannot solve itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face ; but see !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="aye , he enters the sign of storms , the equinox !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From storm to storm !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So be it , then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Born in throes , ' t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So be it , then !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here ' s stout stuff for woe to work on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So be it , then .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil ' s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday ,&quot; murmured Starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The old man seems to read Belshazzar ' s awful writing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have never marked the coin inspectingly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He goes below ; let me read ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A dark valley between three mighty , heaven - abiding peaks , that almost seem the Trinity , in some faint earthly symbol ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So in this vale of Death , God girds us round ; and over all our gloom , the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If we bend down our eyes , the dark vale shows her mouldy soil ; but if we lift them , the bright sun meets our glance half way , to cheer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , oh , the great sun is no fixture ; and if , at midnight , we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him , we gaze for him in vain !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This coin speaks wisely , mildly , truly , but still sadly to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I will quit it , lest Truth shake me falsely .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There now ' s the old Mogul ,&quot; soliloquized Stubb by the try - works , &quot; he ' s been twigging it ; and there goes Starbuck from the same , and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And all from looking at a piece of gold , which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer ' s Hook , I ' d not look at it very long ere spending it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Humph !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="in my poor , insignificant opinion , I regard this as queer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings ; your doubloons of old Spain , your doubloons of Peru , your doubloons of Chili , your doubloons of Bolivia , your doubloons of Popayan ; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles , and joes , and half joes , and quarter joes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By Golconda !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="let me read it once ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Halloa !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="here ' s signs and wonders truly !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That , now , is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac , and what my almanac below calls ditto ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll ' s arithmetic , I ' ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here ' s the book ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let ' s see now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Signs and wonders ; and the sun , he ' s always among ' em ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hem , hem , hem ; here they are -- here they go -- all alive :-- Aries , or the Ram ; Taurus , or the Bull and Jimimi !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="here ' s Gemini himself , or the Twins ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well ; the sun he wheels among ' em ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , here on the coin he ' s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting - rooms all in a ring ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Book !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="you lie there ; the fact is , you books must know your places ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You ' ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ' s my small experience , so far as the Massachusetts calendar , and Bowditch ' s navigator , and Daboll ' s arithmetic go ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Signs and wonders , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s a clue somewhere ; wait a bit ; hist -- hark !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By Jove , I have it !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look you , Doubloon , your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now I ' ll read it off , straight out of the book ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come , Almanack !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To begin : there ' s Aries , or the Ram -- lecherous dog , he begets us ; then , Taurus , or the Bull -- he bumps us the first thing ; then Gemini , or the Twins -- that is , Virtue and Vice ; we try to reach Virtue , when lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="comes Cancer the Crab , and drags us back ; and here , going from Virtue , Leo , a roaring Lion , lies in the path -- he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw ; we escape , and hail Virgo , the Virgin !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that ' s our first love ; we marry and think to be happy for aye , when pop comes Libra , or the Scales -- happiness weighed and found wanting ; and while we are very sad about that , Lord !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how we suddenly jump , as Scorpio , or the Scorpion , stings us in the rear ; we are curing the wound , when whang come the arrows all round ; Sagittarius , or the Archer , is amusing himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As we pluck out the shafts , stand aside !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="here ' s the battering - ram , Capricornus , or the Goat ; full tilt , he comes rushing , and headlong we are tossed ; when Aquarius , or the Water - bearer , pours out his whole deluge and drowns us ; and to wind up with Pisces , or the Fishes , we sleep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s a sermon now , writ in high heaven , and the sun goes through it every year , and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jollily he , aloft there , wheels through toil and trouble ; and so , alow here , does jolly Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , jolly ' s the word for aye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Adieu , Doubloon !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But stop ; here comes little King - Post ; dodge round the try - works , now , and let ' s hear what he ' ll have to say ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ; he ' s before it ; he ' ll out with something presently ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , so ; he ' s beginning .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I see nothing here , but a round thing made of gold , and whoever raises a certain whale , this round thing belongs to him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , what ' s all this staring been about ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is worth sixteen dollars , that ' s true ; and at two cents the cigar , that ' s nine hundred and sixty cigars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I won ' t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb , but I like cigars , and here ' s nine hundred and sixty of them ; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ' em out .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Shall I call that wise or foolish , now ; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it ; yet , if it be really foolish , then has it a sort of wiseish look to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , avast ; here comes our old Manxman -- the old hearse - driver , he must have been , that is , before he took to the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He luffs up before the doubloon ; halloa , and goes round on the other side of the mast ; why , there ' s a horse - shoe nailed on that side ; and now he ' s back again ; what does that mean ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hark !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he ' s muttering -- voice like an old worn - out coffee - mill ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Prick ears , and listen !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; If the White Whale be raised , it must be in a month and a day , when the sun stands in some one of these signs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ve studied signs , and know their marks ; they were taught me two score years ago , by the old witch in Copenhagen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , in what sign will the sun then be ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The horse - shoe sign ; for there it is , right opposite the gold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what ' s the horse - shoe sign ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The lion is the horse - shoe sign -- the roaring and devouring lion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ship , old ship !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="my old head shakes to think of thee .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There ' s another rendering now ; but still one text ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All sorts of men in one kind of world , you see ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dodge again !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="here comes Queequeg -- all tattooing -- looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What says the Cannibal ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As I live he ' s comparing notes ; looking at his thigh bone ; thinks the sun is in the thigh , or in the calf , or in the bowels , I suppose , as the old women talk Surgeon ' s Astronomy in the back country ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And by Jove , he ' s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh -- I guess it ' s Sagittarius , or the Archer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No : he don ' t know what to make of the doubloon ; he takes it for an old button off some king ' s trowsers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , aside again !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="here comes that ghost - devil , Fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What does he say , with that look of his ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin -- fire worshipper , depend upon it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ho !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="more and more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This way comes Pip -- poor boy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="would he had died , or I ; he ' s half horrible to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He too has been watching all of these interpreters -- myself included -- and look now , he comes to read , with that unearthly idiot face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stand away again and hear him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hark !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Upon my soul , he ' s been studying Murray ' s Grammar !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Improving his mind , poor fellow !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Well , that ' s funny .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And I , you , and he ; and we , ye , and they , are all bats ; and I ' m a crow , especially when I stand a ' top of this pine tree here ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="So , so , I leave him muttering .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Here ' s the ship ' s navel , this doubloon here , and they are all on fire to unscrew it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , unscrew your navel , and what ' s the consequence ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then again , if it stays here , that is ugly , too , for when aught ' s nailed to the mast it ' s a sign that things grow desperate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha , ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="old Ahab !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the White Whale ; he ' ll nail ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This is a pine tree ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My father , in old Tolland county , cut down a pine tree once , and found a silver ring grown over in it ; some old darkey ' s wedding ring ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How did it get there ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so they ' ll say in the resurrection , when they come to fish up this old mast , and find a doubloon lodged in it , with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Leg and Arm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pequod , of Nantucket , Meets the Samuel Enderby , of London ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ship , ahoy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hast seen the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So cried Ahab , once more hailing a ship showing English colours , bearing down under the stern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Trumpet to mouth , the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter - boat , his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain , who was carelessly reclining in his own boat ' s bow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was a darkly - tanned , burly , good - natured , fine - looking man , of sixty or thereabouts , dressed in a spacious roundabout , that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot - cloth ; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar ' s surcoat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hast seen the White Whale !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; See you this ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it , he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone , terminating in a wooden head like a mallet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Man my boat !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , impetuously , and tossing about the oars near him --&quot; Stand by to lower !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In less than a minute , without quitting his little craft , he and his crew were dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But here a curious difficulty presented itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the excitement of the moment , Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own , and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod , and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment ' s warning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , it is no very easy matter for anybody -- except those who are almost hourly used to it , like whalemen -- to clamber up a ship ' s side from a boat on the open sea ; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks , and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , deprived of one leg , and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention , Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again ; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It has before been hinted , perhaps , that every little untoward circumstance that befell him , and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap , almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And in the present instance , all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship , leaning over the side , by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there , and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully - ornamented man - ropes ; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one - legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this awkwardness only lasted a minute , because the strange captain , observing at a glance how affairs stood , cried out , &quot; I see , I see !-- avast heaving there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jump , boys , and swing over the cutting - tackle .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved blubber - hook , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This was quickly lowered to Ahab , who at once comprehending it all , slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook ( it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor , or the crotch of an apple tree ), and then giving the word , held himself fast , and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight , by pulling hand - over - hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks , and gently landed upon the capstan head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome , the other captain advanced , and Ahab , putting out his ivory leg , and crossing the ivory arm ( like two sword - fish blades ) cried out in his walrus way , &quot; Aye , aye , hearty !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="let us shake bones together !-- an arm and a leg !-- an arm that never can shrink , d ' ye see ; and a leg that never can run ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where did ' st thou see the White Whale ?-- how long ago ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The White Whale ,&quot; said the Englishman , pointing his ivory arm towards the East , and taking a rueful sight along it , as if it had been a telescope ; &quot; there I saw him , on the Line , last season .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And he took that arm off , did he ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="asked Ahab , now sliding down from the capstan , and resting on the Englishman ' s shoulder , as he did so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , he was the cause of it , at least ; and that leg , too ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Spin me the yarn ,&quot; said Ahab ; &quot; how was it ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line ,&quot; began the Englishman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales , and my boat fastened to one of them ; a regular circus horse he was , too , that went milling and milling round so , that my boat ' s crew could only trim dish , by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale , with a milky - white head and hump , all crows ' feet and wrinkles .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It was he , it was he !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , suddenly letting out his suspended breath ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye -- they were mine -- MY irons ,&quot; cried Ahab , exultingly --&quot; but on !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Give me a chance , then ,&quot; said the Englishman , good - humoredly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , this old great - grandfather , with the white head and hump , runs all afoam into the pod , and goes to snapping furiously at my fast - line !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , I see !-- wanted to part it ; free the fast - fish -- an old trick -- I know him .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; How it was exactly ,&quot; continued the one - armed commander , &quot; I do not know ; but in biting the line , it got foul of his teeth , caught there somehow ; but we didn ' t know it then ; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line , bounce we came plump on to his hump !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="instead of the other whale ' s ; that went off to windward , all fluking ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seeing how matters stood , and what a noble great whale it was -- the noblest and biggest I ever saw , sir , in my life -- I resolved to capture him , spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thinking the hap - hazard line would get loose , or the tooth it was tangled to might draw ( for I have a devil of a boat ' s crew for a pull on a whale - line ); seeing all this , I say , I jumped into my first mate ' s boat -- Mr . Mounttop ' s here ( by the way , Captain -- Mounttop ; Mounttop -- the captain );-- as I was saying , I jumped into Mounttop ' s boat , which , d ' ye see , was gunwale and gunwale with mine , then ; and snatching the first harpoon , let this old great - grandfather have it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , Lord , look you , sir -- hearts and souls alive , man -- the next instant , in a jiff , I was blind as a bat -- both eyes out -- all befogged and bedeadened with black foam -- the whale ' s tail looming straight up out of it , perpendicular in the air , like a marble steeple ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No use sterning all , then ; but as I was groping at midday , with a blinding sun , all crown - jewels ; as I was groping , I say , after the second iron , to toss it overboard -- down comes the tail like a Lima tower , cutting my boat in two , leaving each half in splinters ; and , flukes first , the white hump backed through the wreck , as though it was all chips ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We all struck out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To escape his terrible flailings , I seized hold of my harpoon - pole sticking in him , and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But a combing sea dashed me off , and at the same instant , the fish , taking one good dart forwards , went down like a flash ; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here &quot; ( clapping his hand just below his shoulder ); &quot; yes , caught me just here , I say , and bore me down to Hell ' s flames , I was thinking ; when , when , all of a sudden , thank the good God , the barb ript its way along the flesh -- clear along the whole length of my arm -- came out nigh my wrist , and up I floated ;-- and that gentleman there will tell you the rest ( by the way , captain -- Dr . Bunger , ship ' s surgeon : Bunger , my lad ,-- the captain )." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , Bunger boy , spin your part of the yarn .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out , had been all the time standing near them , with nothing specific visible , to denote his gentlemanly rank on board ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His face was an exceedingly round but sober one ; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt , and patched trowsers ; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand , and a pill - box held in the other , occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , at his superior ' s introduction of him to Ahab , he politely bowed , and straightway went on to do his captain ' s bidding ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; It was a shocking bad wound ,&quot; began the whale - surgeon ; &quot; and , taking my advice , Captain Boomer here , stood our old Sammy --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship ,&quot; interrupted the one - armed captain , addressing Ahab ; &quot; go on , boy .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stood our old Sammy off to the northward , to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But it was no use -- I did all I could ; sat up with him nights ; was very severe with him in the matter of diet --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , very severe !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="chimed in the patient himself ; then suddenly altering his voice , &quot; Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night , till he couldn ' t see to put on the bandages ; and sending me to bed , half seas over , about three o ' clock in the morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , ye stars !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he sat up with me indeed , and was very severe in my diet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a great watcher , and very dietetically severe , is Dr . Bunger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="( Bunger , you dog , laugh out !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="why don ' t ye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You know you ' re a precious jolly rascal .)" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , heave ahead , boy , I ' d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; My captain , you must have ere this perceived , respected sir &quot;-- said the imperturbable godly - looking Bunger , slightly bowing to Ahab --&quot; is apt to be facetious at times ; he spins us many clever things of that sort ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I may as well say -- en passant , as the French remark -- that I myself -- that is to say , Jack Bunger , late of the reverend clergy -- am a strict total abstinence man ; I never drink --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Water !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the captain ; &quot; he never drinks it ; it ' s a sort of fits to him ; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia ; but go on -- go on with the arm story .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Yes , I may as well ,&quot; said the surgeon , coolly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I was about observing , sir , before Captain Boomer ' s facetious interruption , that spite of my best and severest endeavors , the wound kept getting worse and worse ; the truth was , sir , it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw ; more than two feet and several inches long ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I measured it with the lead line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In short , it grew black ; I knew what was threatened , and off it came ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule &quot;-- pointing at it with the marlingspike --&quot; that is the captain ' s work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that club - hammer there put to the end , to knock some one ' s brains out with , I suppose , as he tried mine once ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He flies into diabolical passions sometimes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do ye see this dent , sir &quot;-- removing his hat , and brushing aside his hair , and exposing a bowl - like cavity in his skull , but which bore not the slightest scarry trace , or any token of ever having been a wound --&quot; Well , the captain there will tell you how that came here ; he knows .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , I don ' t ,&quot; said the captain , &quot; but his mother did ; he was born with it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , you solemn rogue , you -- you Bunger !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Bunger , when you die , you ought to die in pickle , you dog ; you should be preserved to future ages , you rascal .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What became of the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="now cried Ahab , who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by - play between the two Englishmen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the one - armed captain , &quot; oh , yes !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well ; after he sounded , we didn ' t see him again for some time ; in fact , as I before hinted , I didn ' t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick , till some time afterwards , when coming back to the Line , we heard about Moby Dick -- as some call him -- and then I knew it was he .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Did ' st thou cross his wake again ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Twice .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But could not fasten ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Didn ' t want to try to : ain ' t one limb enough ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What should I do without this other arm ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I ' m thinking Moby Dick doesn ' t bite so much as he swallows .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , then ,&quot; interrupted Bunger , &quot; give him your left arm for bait to get the right ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do you know , gentlemen &quot;-- very gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession --&quot; Do you know , gentlemen , that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence , that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man ' s arm ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And he knows it too ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that what you take for the White Whale ' s malice is only his awkwardness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For he never means to swallow a single limb ; he only thinks to terrify by feints ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow , formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon , that making believe swallow jack - knives , once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest , and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more ; when I gave him an emetic , and he heaved it up in small tacks , d ' ye see ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No possible way for him to digest that jack - knife , and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , Captain Boomer , if you are quick enough about it , and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other , why in that case the arm is yours ; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly , that ' s all .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , thank ye , Bunger ,&quot; said the English Captain , &quot; he ' s welcome to the arm he has , since I can ' t help it , and didn ' t know him then ; but not to another one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No more White Whales for me ; I ' ve lowered for him once , and that has satisfied me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There would be great glory in killing him , I know that ; and there is a ship - load of precious sperm in him , but , hark ye , he ' s best let alone ; don ' t you think so , Captain ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- glancing at the ivory leg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He is ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he will still be hunted , for all that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What is best let alone , that accursed thing is not always what least allures ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ' s all a magnet !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How long since thou saw ' st him last ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Which way heading ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Bless my soul , and curse the foul fiend ' s ,&quot; cried Bunger , stoopingly walking round Ahab , and like a dog , strangely snuffing ; &quot; this man ' s blood -- bring the thermometer !-- it ' s at the boiling point !-- his pulse makes these planks beat !-- sir !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- taking a lancet from his pocket , and drawing near to Ahab ' s arm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Avast !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="roared Ahab , dashing him against the bulwarks --&quot; Man the boat !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Which way heading ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Good God !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the English Captain , to whom the question was put ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s the matter ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was heading east , I think .-- Is your Captain crazy ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="whispering Fedallah ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Fedallah , putting a finger on his lip , slid over the bulwarks to take the boat ' s steering oar , and Ahab , swinging the cutting - tackle towards him , commanded the ship ' s sailors to stand by to lower ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a moment he was standing in the boat ' s stern , and the Manilla men were springing to their oars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In vain the English Captain hailed him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With back to the stranger ship , and face set like a flint to his own , Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 101" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Decanter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere the English ship fades from sight , be it set down here , that she hailed from London , and was named after the late Samuel Enderby , merchant of that city , the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby &amp; Sons ; a house which in my poor whaleman ' s opinion , comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons , in point of real historical interest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How long , prior to the year of our Lord 1775 , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous fish - documents do not make plain ; but in that year ( 1775 ) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale ; though for some score of years previous ( ever since 1726 ) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan , but only in the North and South Atlantic : not elsewhere ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be it distinctly recorded here , that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In 1778 , a fine ship , the Amelia , fitted out for the express purpose , and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys , boldly rounded Cape Horn , and was the first among the nations to lower a whale - boat of any sort in the great South Sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The voyage was a skilful and lucky one ; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm , the Amelia ' s example was soon followed by other ships , English and American , and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not content with this good deed , the indefatigable house again bestirred itself : Samuel and all his Sons -- how many , their mother only knows -- and under their immediate auspices , and partly , I think , at their expense , the British government was induced to send the sloop - of - war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Commanded by a naval Post - Captain , the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it , and did some service ; how much does not appear ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this is not all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In 1819 , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own , to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ship -- well called the &quot; Syren &quot;-- made a noble experimental cruise ; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin , a Nantucketer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All honour to the Enderbies , therefore , whose house , I think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship named after him was worthy of the honour , being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast , and drank good flip down in the forecastle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a fine gam we had , and they were all trumps -- every soul on board ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A short life to them , and a jolly death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And that fine gam I had -- long , very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel -- it minds me of the noble , solid , Saxon hospitality of that ship ; and may my parson forget me , and the devil remember me , if I ever lose sight of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Flip ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Did I say we had flip ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came ( for it ' s squally off there by Patagonia ), and all hands -- visitors and all -- were called to reef topsails , we were so top - heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines ; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , reefed fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all drunken tars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However , the masts did not go overboard ; and by and by we scrambled down , so sober , that we had to pass the flip again , though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle , rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The beef was fine -- tough , but with body in it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They said it was bull - beef ; others , that it was dromedary beef ; but I do not know , for certain , how that was ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They had dumplings too ; small , but substantial , symmetrically globular , and indestructible dumplings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I fancied that you could feel them , and roll them about in you after they were swallowed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If you stooped over too far forward , you risked their pitching out of you like billiard - balls ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The bread -- but that couldn ' t be helped ; besides , it was an anti - scorbutic ; in short , the bread contained the only fresh fare they had ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the forecastle was not very light , and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all in all , taking her from truck to helm , considering the dimensions of the cook ' s boilers , including his own live parchment boilers ; fore and aft , I say , the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship ; of good fare and plenty ; fine flip and strong ; crack fellows all , and capital from boot heels to hat - band ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But why was it , think ye , that the Samuel Enderby , and some other English whalers I know of -- not all though -- were such famous , hospitable ships ; that passed round the beef , and the bread , and the can , and the joke ; and were not soon weary of eating , and drinking , and laughing ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I will tell you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research , when it has seemed needed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders , Zealanders , and Danes ; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old fashions , touching plenty to eat and drink ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , as a general thing , the English merchant - ship scrimps her crew ; but not so the English whaler ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hence , in the English , this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural , but incidental and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special origin , which is here pointed out , and will be still further elucidated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="During my researches in the Leviathanic histories , I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume , which , by the musty whaling smell of it , I knew must be about whalers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The title was , &quot; Dan Coopman ,&quot; wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one &quot; Fitz Swackhammer .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But my friend Dr . Snodhead , a very learned man , professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St . Pott ' s , to whom I handed the work for translation , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble -- this same Dr . Snodhead , so soon as he spied the book , assured me that &quot; Dan Coopman &quot; did not mean &quot; The Cooper ,&quot; but &quot; The Merchant .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In short , this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And in this chapter it was , headed , &quot; Smeer ,&quot; or &quot; Fat ,&quot; that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen ; from which list , as translated by Dr . Snodhead , I transcribe the following :" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="400 , 000 lbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="of beef ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="60 , 000 lbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Friesland pork ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="150 , 000 lbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="of stock fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="550 , 000 lbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="of biscuit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="72 , 000 lbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="of soft bread ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="2 , 800 firkins of butter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="20 , 000 lbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Texel &amp; Leyden cheese ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="144 , 000 lbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cheese ( probably an inferior article )." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="550 ankers of Geneva ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="10 , 800 barrels of beer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading ; not so in the present case , however , where the reader is flooded with whole pipes , barrels , quarts , and gills of good gin and good cheer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the time , I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me , capable of a transcendental and Platonic application ; and , furthermore , I compiled supplementary tables of my own , touching the probable quantity of stock - fish , etc ., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the first place , the amount of butter , and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed , seems amazing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I impute it , though , to their naturally unctuous natures , being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas , on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The quantity of beer , too , is very large , 10 , 800 barrels ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate , so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail , we have 5 , 400 Low Dutch seamen in all ; therefore , I say , we have precisely two barrels of beer per man , for a twelve weeks ' allowance , exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat ' s head , and take good aim at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat improbable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet they did aim at them , and hit them too ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this was very far North , be it remembered , where beer agrees well with the constitution ; upon the Equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast - head and boozy in his boat ; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no more ; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers ; and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this empties the decanter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 102" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A Bower in the Arsacides ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hitherto , in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale , I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect ; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him , it behooves me now to unbutton him still further , and untagging the points of his hose , unbuckling his garters , and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones , set him before you in his ultimatum ; that is to say , in his unconditional skeleton ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But how now , Ishmael ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How is it , that you , a mere oarsman in the fishery , pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Did erudite Stubb , mounted upon your capstan , deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea ; and by help of the windlass , hold up a specimen rib for exhibition ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Explain thyself , Ishmael ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can you land a full - grown whale on your deck for examination , as a cook dishes a roast - pig ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Surely not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A veritable witness have you hitherto been , Ishmael ; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone ; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams ; the rafters , ridge - pole , sleepers , and under - pinnings , making up the frame - work of leviathan ; and belike of the tallow - vats , dairy - rooms , butteries , and cheeseries in his bowels ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I confess , that since Jonah , few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale ; nevertheless , I have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a ship I belonged to , a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag , to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons , and for the heads of the lances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Think you I let that chance go , without using my boat - hatchet and jack - knife , and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic , full grown development , for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo , king of Tranque , one of the Arsacides ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For being at Tranque , years ago , when attached to the trading - ship Dey of Algiers , I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque , at his retired palm villa at Pupella ; a sea - side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo - Town , his capital ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Among many other fine qualities , my royal friend Tranquo , being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu , had brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent ; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices , chiselled shells , inlaid spears , costly paddles , aromatic canoes ; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders , the wonder - freighted , tribute - rendering waves had cast upon his shores ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale , which , after an unusually long raging gale , had been found dead and stranded , with his head against a cocoa - nut tree , whose plumage - like , tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom - deep enfoldings , and the bones become dust dry in the sun , then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen , where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ribs were hung with trophies ; the vertebrae were carved with Arsacidean annals , in strange hieroglyphics ; in the skull , the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame , so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapoury spout ; while , suspended from a bough , the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees , like the hair - hung sword that so affrighted Damocles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a wondrous sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living sap ; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver ' s loom , with a gorgeous carpet on it , whereof the ground - vine tendrils formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the shrubs , and ferns , and grasses ; the message - carrying air ; all these unceasingly were active ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Through the lacings of the leaves , the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , busy weaver !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="unseen weaver !-- pause !-- one word !-- whither flows the fabric ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what palace may it deck ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="wherefore all these ceaseless toilings ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Speak , weaver !-- stay thy hand !-- but one single word with thee !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nay -- the shuttle flies -- the figures float from forth the loom ; the freshet - rushing carpet for ever slides away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The weaver - god , he weaves ; and by that weaving is he deafened , that he hears no mortal voice ; and by that humming , we , too , who look on the loom are deafened ; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For even so it is in all material factories ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles ; those same words are plainly heard without the walls , bursting from the opened casements ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thereby have villainies been detected ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah , mortal !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="then , be heedful ; for so , in all this din of the great world ' s loom , thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , amid the green , life - restless loom of that Arsacidean wood , the great , white , worshipped skeleton lay lounging -- a gigantic idler !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , as the ever - woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him , the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver ; himself all woven over with the vines ; every month assuming greener , fresher verdure ; but himself a skeleton ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Life folded Death ; Death trellised Life ; the grim god wived with youthful Life , and begat him curly - headed glories ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He laughed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To and fro I paced before this skeleton -- brushed the vines aside -- broke through the ribs -- and with a ball of Arsacidean twine , wandered , eddied long amid its many winding , shaded colonnades and arbours ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But soon my line was out ; and following it back , I emerged from the opening where I entered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Cutting me a green measuring - rod , I once more dived within the skeleton ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From their arrow - slit in the skull , the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib , &quot; How now !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="they shouted ; &quot; Dar ' st thou measure this our god !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That ' s for us .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , priests -- well , how long do ye make him , then ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them , concerning feet and inches ; they cracked each other ' s sconces with their yard - sticks -- the great skull echoed -- and seizing that lucky chance , I quickly concluded my own admeasurements ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These admeasurements I now propose to set before you ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But first , be it recorded , that , in this matter , I am not free to utter any fancied measurement I please ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to , to test my accuracy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is a Leviathanic Museum , they tell me , in Hull , England , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin - backs and other whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Likewise , I have heard that in the museum of Manchester , in New Hampshire , they have what the proprietors call &quot; the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover , at a place in Yorkshire , England , Burton Constable by name , a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale , but of moderate size , by no means of the full - grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In both cases , the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged , were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it ; and Sir Clifford , because he was lord of the seignories of those parts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sir Clifford ' s whale has been articulated throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony cavities -- spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan -- and swing all day upon his lower jaw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Locks are to be put upon some of his trap - doors and shutters ; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column ; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum ; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm , where I had them tattooed ; as in my wild wanderings at that period , there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as I was crowded for space , and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing -- at least , what untattooed parts might remain -- I did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 103" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Measurement of The Whale ' s Skeleton ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the first place , I wish to lay before you a particular , plain statement , touching the living bulk of this leviathan , whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such a statement may prove useful here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="According to a careful calculation I have made , and which I partly base upon Captain Scoresby ' s estimate , of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length ; according to my careful calculation , I say , a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude , between eighty - five and ninety feet in length , and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference , such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons ; so that , reckoning thirteen men to a ton , he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Think you not then that brains , like yoked cattle , should be put to this leviathan , to make him at all budge to any landsman ' s imagination ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Having already in various ways put before you his skull , spout - hole , jaw , teeth , tail , forehead , fins , and divers other parts , I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton ; as it is by far the most complicated part ; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter , you must not fail to carry it in your mind , or under your arm , as we proceed , otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In length , the Sperm Whale ' s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy - two Feet ; so that when fully invested and extended in life , he must have been ninety feet long ; for in the whale , the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of this seventy - two feet , his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet , leaving some fifty feet of plain back - bone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Attached to this back - bone , for something less than a third of its length , was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To me this vast ivory - ribbed chest , with the long , unrelieved spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new - laid upon the stocks , when only some twenty of her naked bow - ribs are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , disconnected timber ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ribs were ten on a side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each successively longer , till you came to the climax of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In general thickness , they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The middle ribs were the most arched ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In considering these ribs , I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so variously repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The largest of the Tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , for some way , where I now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , muscle , blood , and bowels ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still more , for the ample fins , I here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the weighty and majestic , but boneless flukes , an utter blank !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How vain and foolish , then , thought I , for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only in the heart of quickest perils ; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes ; only on the profound unbounded sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the spine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For that , the best way we can consider it is , with a crane , to pile its bones high up on end ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No speedy enterprise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But now it ' s done , it looks much like Pompey ' s Pillar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There are forty and odd vertebrae in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire , forming solid courses of heavy masonry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The largest , a middle one , is in width something less than three feet , and in depth more than four ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in width , and looks something like a white billiard - ball ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins , the priest ' s children , who had stolen them to play marbles with ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child ' s play ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 104" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Fossil Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge , amplify , and generally expatiate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Would you , you could not compress him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail , and the yards he measures about the waist ; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines , where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop - deck of a line - of - battle - ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan , it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise ; not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood , and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities , it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological , fossiliferous , and antediluvian point of view ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan -- to an ant or a flea -- such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when Leviathan is the text , the case is altered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And here be it said , that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations , I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson , expressly purchased for that purpose ; because that famous lexicographer ' s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How , then , with me , writing of this Leviathan ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Give me a condor ' s quill !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Give me Vesuvius ' crater for an inkstand !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Friends , hold my arms !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan , they weary me , and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep , as if to include the whole circle of the sciences , and all the generations of whales , and men , and mastodons , past , present , and to come , with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth , and throughout the whole universe , not excluding its suburbs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such , and so magnifying , is the virtue of a large and liberal theme !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We expand to its bulk ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To produce a mighty book , you must choose a mighty theme ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea , though many there be who have tried it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales , I present my credentials as a geologist , by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone - mason , and also a great digger of ditches , canals and wells , wine - vaults , cellars , and cisterns of all sorts ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Likewise , by way of preliminary , I desire to remind the reader , that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct ; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting , or at any rate intercepted links , between the antichronical creatures , and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark ; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period , which is the last preceding the superficial formations ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time , they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects , to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Detached broken fossils of pre - adamite whales , fragments of their bones and skeletons , have within thirty years past , at various intervals , been found at the base of the Alps , in Lombardy , in France , in England , in Scotland , and in the States of Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull , which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris , a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries ; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp , in Napoleon ' s time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile , and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah , some fifty years ago , there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere , abounding in centaurs , griffins , and dolphins , similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Does the Whale ' s Magnitude Diminish ?-- Will He Perish ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Inasmuch , then , as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head - waters of the Eternities , it may be fitly inquired , whether , in the long course of his generations , he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But upon investigation we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system ( embracing a distinct geological period prior to man ), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system , those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Of all the pre - adamite whales yet exhumed , by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whereas , we have already seen , that the tape - measure gives seventy - two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I have heard , on whalemen ' s authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods ; may it not be , that since Adam ' s time they have degenerated ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Assuredly , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk , and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length -- Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And even in the days of Banks and Solander , Cooke ' s naturalists , we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales ( reydan - siskur , or Wrinkled Bellies ) at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And Lacepede , the French naturalist , in his elaborate history of whales , in the very beginning of his work ( page 3 ), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres , three hundred and twenty - eight feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this work was published so late as A . D . 1825 ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But will any whaleman believe these stories ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The whale of to - day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny ' s time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if ever I go where Pliny is , I , a whaleman ( more than he was ), will make bold to tell him so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because I cannot understand how it is , that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born , do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks ; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets , by the relative proportions in which they are drawn , just as plainly prove that the high - bred , stall - fed , prize cattle of Smithfield , not only equal , but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh ' s fat kine ; in the face of all this , I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether owing to the almost omniscient look - outs at the mast - heads of the whaleships , now penetrating even through Behring ' s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts ; the moot point is , whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a havoc ; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself evaporate in the final puff ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo , which , not forty years ago , overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri , and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder - clotted brows upon the sites of populous river - capitals , where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch ; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished , to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But you must look at this matter in every light ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though so short a period ago -- not a good lifetime -- the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London , and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region ; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man ; yet the far different nature of the whale - hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty - eight months think they have done extremely well , and thank God , if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whereas , in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West , when the far west ( in whose sunset suns still rise ) was a wilderness and a virgin , the same number of moccasined men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more buffaloes ; a fact that , if need were , could be statistically stated ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , considered aright , does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale , for example , that in former years ( the latter part of the last century , say ) these Leviathans , in small pods , were encountered much oftener than at present , and , in consequence , the voyages were not so prolonged , and were also much more remunerative ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because , as has been elsewhere noticed , those whales , influenced by some views to safety , now swim the seas in immense caravans , so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries , yokes , and pods , and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated , unfrequent armies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That is all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And equally fallacious seems the conceit , that because the so - called whale - bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them , hence that species also is declining ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For they are only being driven from promontory to cape ; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets , then , be sure , some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Furthermore : concerning these last mentioned Leviathans , they have two firm fortresses , which , in all human probability , will for ever remain impregnable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as upon the invasion of their valleys , the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains ; so , hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas , the whale - bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels , and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there , come up among icy fields and floes ; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December , bid defiance to all pursuit from man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as perhaps fifty of these whale - bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot , some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than 13 , 000 , have been annually slain on the nor '- west coast by the Americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe , yet what shall we say to Harto , the historian of Goa , when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took 4 , 000 elephants ; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants , which have now been hunted for thousands of years , by Semiramis , by Porus , by Hannibal , and by all the successive monarchs of the East -- if they still survive there in great numbers , much more may the great whale outlast all hunting , since he has a pasture to expatiate in , which is precisely twice as large as all Asia , both Americas , Europe and Africa , New Holland , and all the Isles of the sea combined ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover : we are to consider , that from the presumed great longevity of whales , their probably attaining the age of a century and more , therefore at any one period of time , several distinct adult generations must be contemporary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by imagining all the grave - yards , cemeteries , and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive seventy - five years ago ; and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wherefore , for all these things , we account the whale immortal in his species , however perishable in his individuality ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He swam the seas before the continents broke water ; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries , and Windsor Castle , and the Kremlin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In Noah ' s flood he despised Noah ' s Ark ; and if ever the world is to be again flooded , like the Netherlands , to kill off its rats , then the eternal whale will still survive , and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood , spout his frothed defiance to the skies ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 106" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab ' s Leg ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London , had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half - splintering shock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when after gaining his own deck , and his own pivot - hole there , he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman ( it was , as ever , something about his not steering inflexibly enough ); then , the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench , that though it still remained entire , and to all appearances lusty , yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , indeed , it seemed small matter for wonder , that for all his pervading , mad recklessness , Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod ' s sailing from Nantucket , that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground , and insensible ; by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable casualty , his ivory limb having been so violently displaced , that it had stake - wise smitten , and all but pierced his groin ; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove ; so , equally with every felicity , all miserable events do naturally beget their like ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yea , more than equally , thought Ahab ; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , not to hint of this : that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings , that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world , but , on the contrary , shall be followed by the joy - childlessness of all hell ' s despair ; whereas , some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave ; not at all to hint of this , there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For , thought Ahab , while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them , but , at bottom , all heartwoes , a mystic significance , and , in some men , an archangelic grandeur ; so do their diligent tracings - out not belie the obvious deduction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries , carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods ; so that , in the face of all the glad , hay - making suns , and soft cymballing , round harvest - moons , we must needs give in to this : that the gods themselves are not for ever glad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ineffaceable , sad birth - mark in the brow of man , is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged , which perhaps might more properly , in set way , have been disclosed before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With many other particulars concerning Ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some , why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the sailing of the Pequod , he had hidden himself away with such Grand - Lama - like exclusiveness ; and , for that one interval , sought speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble senate of the dead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Peleg ' s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate ; though , indeed , as touching all Ahab ' s deeper part , every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , in the end , it all came out ; this one matter did , at least ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And not only this , but to that ever - contracting , dropping circle ashore , who , for any reason , possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him ; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty -- remaining , as it did , moodily unaccounted for by Ahab -- invested itself with terrors , not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that , through their zeal for him , they had all conspired , so far as in them lay , to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others ; and hence it was , that not till a considerable interval had elapsed , did it transpire upon the Pequod ' s decks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But be all this as it may ; let the unseen , ambiguous synod in the air , or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire , have to do or not with earthly Ahab , yet , in this present matter of his leg , he took plain practical procedures ;-- he called the carpenter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when that functionary appeared before him , he bade him without delay set about making a new leg , and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw - ivory ( Sperm Whale ) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage , in order that a careful selection of the stoutest , clearest - grained stuff might be secured ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the fittings for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moreover , the ship ' s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold ; and , to accelerate the affair , the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 107" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Carpenter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn , and take high abstracted man alone ; and he seems a wonder , a grandeur , and a woe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But from the same point , take mankind in mass , and for the most part , they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates , both contemporary and hereditary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But most humble though he was , and far from furnishing an example of the high , humane abstraction ; the Pequod ' s carpenter was no duplicate ; hence , he now comes in person on this stage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like all sea - going ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain off - handed , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own ; the carpenter ' s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , besides the application to him of the generic remark above , this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship , upon a three or four years ' voyage , in uncivilized and far - distant seas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties :-- repairing stove boats , sprung spars , reforming the shape of clumsy - bladed oars , inserting bull ' s eyes in the deck , or new tree - nails in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes , both useful and capricious ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold , was his vice - bench ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices , of different sizes , and both of iron and of wood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try - works ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole : the carpenter claps it into one of his ever - ready vices , and straightway files it smaller ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A lost land - bird of strange plumage strays on board , and is made a captive : out of clean shaved rods of right - whale bone , and cross - beams of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a pagoda - looking cage for it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An oarsman sprains his wrist : the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark - bone ear - rings : the carpenter drills his ears ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Another has the toothache : the carpenter out pincers , and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there ; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus , this carpenter was prepared at all points , and alike indifferent and without respect in all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Teeth he accounted bits of ivory ; heads he deemed but top - blocks ; men themselves he lightly held for capstans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him , too ; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But not precisely so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For nothing was this man more remarkable , than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were ; impersonal , I say ; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things , that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world ; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes , still eternally holds its peace , and ignores you , though you dig foundations for cathedrals ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet was this half - horrible stolidity in him , involving , too , as it appeared , an all - ramifying heartlessness ;-- yet was it oddly dashed at times , with an old , crutch - like , antediluvian , wheezing humorousness , not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness ; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah ' s ark ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Was it that this old carpenter had been a life - long wanderer , whose much rolling , to and fro , not only had gathered no moss ; but what is more , had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was a stript abstract ; an unfractioned integral ; uncompromised as a new - born babe ; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You might almost say , that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence ; for in his numerous trades , he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct , or simply because he had been tutored to it , or by any intermixture of all these , even or uneven ; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb , spontaneous literal process ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was a pure manipulator ; his brain , if he had ever had one , must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful , MULTUM IN PARVO , Sheffield contrivances , assuming the exterior -- though a little swelled -- of a common pocket knife ; but containing , not only blades of various sizes , but also screw - drivers , cork - screws , tweezers , awls , pens , rulers , nail - filers , countersinkers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw - driver , all they had to do was to open that part of him , and the screw was fast : or if for tweezers , take him up by the legs , and there they were ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet , as previously hinted , this omnitooled , open - and - shut carpenter , was , after all , no mere machine of an automaton ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If he did not have a common soul in him , he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What that was , whether essence of quicksilver , or a few drops of hartshorn , there is no telling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But there it was ; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this it was , this same unaccountable , cunning life - principle in him ; this it was , that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing ; but only like an unreasoning wheel , which also hummingly soliloquizes ; or rather , his body was a sentry - box and this soliloquizer on guard there , and talking all the time to keep himself awake ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="If the captain pleases , I will now mark the length ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="This is a cogent vice thou hast here , carpenter ; let me feel its grip once ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="No fear ; I like a good grip ; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s Prometheus about there ?-- the blacksmith , I mean -- what ' s he about ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He must be forging the buckle - screw , sir , now ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="It ' s a partnership ; he supplies the muscle part ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He makes a fierce red flame there !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Um - m ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So he must ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I do deem it now a most meaning thing , that that old Greek , Prometheus , who made men , they say , should have been a blacksmith , and animated them with fire ; for what ' s made in fire must properly belong to fire ; and so hell ' s probable ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Well , then , will it speak thoroughly well for thy work , if , when I come to mount this leg thou makest , I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it ; that is , carpenter , my old lost leg ; the flesh and blood one , I mean ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Canst thou not drive that old Adam away ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Truly , sir , I begin to understand somewhat now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , I have heard something curious on that score , sir ; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar , but it will be still pricking him at times ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="May I humbly ask if it be really so , sir ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is , man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look , put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was ; so , now , here is only one distinct leg to the eye , yet two to the soul ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Hold , don ' t speak !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg , though it be now so long dissolved ; then , why mayst not thou , carpenter , feel the fiery pains of hell for ever , and without a body ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Good Lord !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Truly , sir , if it comes to that , I must calculate over again ; I think I didn ' t carry a small figure , sir ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look ye , pudding - heads should never grant premises .-- How long before the leg is done ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="CHAPTER 109" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning ; and lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="no inconsiderable oil came up with the water ; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Much concern was shown ; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* In Sperm - whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board , it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold , and drench the casks with sea - water ; which afterwards , at varying intervals , is removed by the ship ' s pumps ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight ; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water , the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the Bashee Isles , between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China waters into the Pacific ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him ; and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands -- Niphon , Matsmai , and Sikoke ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With his snow - white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table , and with a long pruning - hook of a jack - knife in his hand , the wondrous old man , with his back to the gangway door , was wrinkling his brow , and tracing his old courses again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Who ' s there ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="hearing the footstep at the door , but not turning round to it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; On deck !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Begone !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Ahab mistakes ; it is I ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The oil in the hold is leaking , sir ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We must up Burtons and break out .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Up Burtons and break out ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now that we are nearing Japan ; heave - to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Either do that , sir , or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; So it is , so it is ; if we get it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I was speaking of the oil in the hold , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Begone !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let it leak !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' m all aleak myself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="leaks in leaks !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="not only full of leaky casks , but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship ; and that ' s a far worse plight than the Pequod ' s , man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet I don ' t stop to plug my leak ; for who can find it in the deep - loaded hull ; or how hope to plug it , even if found , in this life ' s howling gale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starbuck !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll not have the Burtons hoisted .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What will the owners say , sir ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What cares Ahab ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Owners , owners ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou art always prating to me , Starbuck , about those miserly owners , as if the owners were my conscience ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But look ye , the only real owner of anything is its commander ; and hark ye , my conscience is in this ship ' s keel .-- On deck !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Captain Ahab ,&quot; said the reddening mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; &quot; A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man ; aye , and in a happier , Captain Ahab .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Devils !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me ?-- On deck !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Nay , sir , not yet ; I do entreat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I do dare , sir -- to be forbearing !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto , Captain Ahab ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack ( forming part of most South - Sea - men ' s cabin furniture ), and pointing it towards Starbuck , exclaimed : &quot; There is one God that is Lord over the earth , and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod .-- On deck !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate , and his fiery cheeks , you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , mastering his emotion , he half calmly rose , and as he quitted the cabin , paused for an instant and said : &quot; Thou hast outraged , not insulted me , sir ; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck ; thou wouldst but laugh ; but let Ahab beware of Ahab ; beware of thyself , old man .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He waxes brave , but nevertheless obeys ; most careful bravery that !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="murmured Ahab , as Starbuck disappeared ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s that he said -- Ahab beware of Ahab -- there ' s something there !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff , with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin ; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed , and returning the gun to the rack , he went to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou art but too good a fellow , Starbuck ,&quot; he said lowly to the mate ; then raising his voice to the crew : &quot; Furl the t ' gallant - sails , and close - reef the top - sails , fore and aft ; back the main - yard ; up Burton , and break out in the main - hold .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was , that as respecting Starbuck , Ahab thus acted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It may have been a flash of honesty in him ; or mere prudential policy which , under the circumstance , imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection , however transient , in the important chief officer of his ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="However it was , his orders were executed ; and the Burtons were hoisted ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 110" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg in His Coffin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon searching , it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound , and that the leak must be further off ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , it being calm weather , they broke out deeper and deeper , disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground - tier butts ; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So deep did they go ; and so ancient , and corroded , and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons , that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner - stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah , with copies of the posted placards , vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tierce after tierce , too , of water , and bread , and beef , and shooks of staves , and iron bundles of hoops , were hoisted out , till at last the piled decks were hard to get about ; and the hollow hull echoed under foot , as if you were treading over empty catacombs , and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air - freighted demijohn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Top - heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , at this time it was that my poor pagan companion , and fast bosom - friend , Queequeg , was seized with a fever , which brought him nigh to his endless end ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Be it said , that in this vocation of whaling , sinecures are unknown ; dignity and danger go hand in hand ; till you get to be Captain , the higher you rise the harder you toil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So with poor Queequeg , who , as harpooneer , must not only face all the rage of the living whale , but -- as we have elsewhere seen -- mount his dead back in a rolling sea ; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold , and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement , resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To be short , among whalemen , the harpooneers are the holders , so called ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Poor Queequeg !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="when the ship was about half disembowelled , you should have stooped over the hatchway , and peered down upon him there ; where , stripped to his woollen drawers , the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime , like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And a well , or an ice - house , it somehow proved to him , poor pagan ; where , strange to say , for all the heat of his sweatings , he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever ; and at last , after some days ' suffering , laid him in his hammock , close to the very sill of the door of death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How he wasted and wasted away in those few long - lingering days , till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as all else in him thinned , and his cheek - bones grew sharper , his eyes , nevertheless , seemed growing fuller and fuller ; they became of a strange softness of lustre ; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness , a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die , or be weakened ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And like circles on the water , which , as they grow fainter , expand ; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding , like the rings of Eternity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage , and saw as strange things in his face , as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And the drawing near of Death , which alike levels all , alike impresses all with a last revelation , which only an author from the dead could adequately tell ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that -- let us say it again -- no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those , whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg , as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock , and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest , and the ocean ' s invisible flood - tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not a man of the crew but gave him up ; and , as for Queequeg himself , what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He called one to him in the grey morning watch , when the day was just breaking , and taking his hand , said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood , like the rich war - wood of his native isle ; and upon inquiry , he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket , were laid in those same dark canoes , and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him ; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race , who , after embalming a dead warrior , stretched him out in his canoe , and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes ; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles , but that far beyond all visible horizons , their own mild , uncontinented seas , interflow with the blue heavens ; and so form the white breakers of the milky way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He added , that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock , according to the usual sea - custom , tossed like something vile to the death - devouring sharks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No : he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket , all the more congenial to him , being a whaleman , that like a whale - boat these coffin - canoes were without a keel ; though that involved but uncertain steering , and much lee - way adown the dim ages ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft , the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg ' s bidding , whatever it might include ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was some heathenish , coffin - coloured old lumber aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands , and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order , than taking his rule , he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character , proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg ' s measure with great accuracy , regularly chalking Queequeg ' s person as he shifted the rule ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="poor fellow !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he ' ll have to die now ,&quot; ejaculated the Long Island sailor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Going to his vice - bench , the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference , now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be , and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This done , he marshalled the planks and his tools , and to work ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When the last nail was driven , and the lid duly planed and fitted , he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it , inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Overhearing the indignant but half - humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away , Queequeg , to every one ' s consternation , commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him , nor was there any denying him ; seeing that , of all mortals , some dying men are the most tyrannical ; and certainly , since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore , the poor fellows ought to be indulged ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Leaning over in his hammock , Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He then called for his harpoon , had the wooden stock drawn from it , and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All by his own request , also , biscuits were then ranged round the sides within : a flask of fresh water was placed at the head , and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot ; and a piece of sail - cloth being rolled up for a pillow , Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed , that he might make trial of its comforts , if any it had ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He lay without moving a few minutes , then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god , Yojo ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between , he called for the coffin lid ( hatch he called it ) to be placed over him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The head part turned over with a leather hinge , and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Rarmai &quot; ( it will do ; it is easy ), he murmured at last , and signed to be replaced in his hammock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ere this was done , Pip , who had been slily hovering near by all this while , drew nigh to him where he lay , and with soft sobbings , took him by the hand ; in the other , holding his tambourine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Poor rover !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="will ye never have done with all this weary roving ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="where go ye now ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water - lilies , will ye do one little errand for me ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seek out one Pip , who ' s now been missing long : I think he ' s in those far Antilles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If ye find him , then comfort him ; for he must be very sad ; for look !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he ' s left his tambourine behind ;-- I found it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Rig - a - dig , dig , dig !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , Queequeg , die ; and I ' ll beat ye your dying march .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I have heard ,&quot; murmured Starbuck , gazing down the scuttle , &quot; that in violent fevers , men , all ignorance , have talked in ancient tongues ; and that when the mystery is probed , it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , to my fond faith , poor Pip , in this strange sweetness of his lunacy , brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where learned he that , but there ?-- Hark !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he speaks again : but more wildly now .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Form two and two !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let ' s make a General of him !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ho , where ' s his harpoon ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lay it across here .-- Rig - a - dig , dig , dig !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="huzza !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Queequeg dies game !-- mind ye that ; Queequeg dies game !-- take ye good heed of that ; Queequeg dies game !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I say ; game , game , game !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="but base little Pip , he died a coward ; died all a ' shiver ;-- out upon Pip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hark ye ; if ye find Pip , tell all the Antilles he ' s a runaway ; a coward , a coward , a coward !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tell them he jumped from a whale - boat !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' d never beat my tambourine over base Pip , and hail him General , if he were once more dying here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , no !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shame upon all cowards -- shame upon them !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let ' em go drown like Pip , that jumped from a whale - boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shame !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shame !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="During all this , Queequeg lay with closed eyes , as if in a dream ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pip was led away , and the sick man was replaced in his hammock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death ; now that his coffin was proved a good fit , Queequeg suddenly rallied ; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter ' s box : and thereupon , when some expressed their delighted surprise , he , in substance , said , that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this ;-- at a critical moment , he had just recalled a little duty ashore , which he was leaving undone ; and therefore had changed his mind about dying : he could not die yet , he averred ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They asked him , then , whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He answered , certainly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a word , it was Queequeg ' s conceit , that if a man made up his mind to live , mere sickness could not kill him : nothing but a whale , or a gale , or some violent , ungovernable , unintelligent destroyer of that sort ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized ; that while a sick , civilized man may be six months convalescing , generally speaking , a sick savage is almost half - well again in a day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , in good time my Queequeg gained strength ; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days ( but eating with a vigorous appetite ) he suddenly leaped to his feet , threw out his arms and legs , gave himself a good stretching , yawned a little bit , and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat , and poising a harpoon , pronounced himself fit for a fight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a wild whimsiness , he now used his coffin for a sea - chest ; and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes , set them in order there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Many spare hours he spent , in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings ; and it seemed that hereby he was striving , in his rude way , to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island , who , by those hieroglyphic marks , had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth , and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth ; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold ; a wondrous work in one volume ; but whose mysteries not even himself could read , though his own live heart beat against them ; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed , and so be unsolved to the last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his , when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg --&quot; Oh , devilish tantalization of the gods !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 111" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pacific ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea ; were it not for other things , I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks , for now the long supplication of my youth was answered ; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St . John ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And meet it is , that over these sea - pastures , wide - rolling watery prairies and Potters ' Fields of all four continents , the waves should rise and fall , and ebb and flow unceasingly ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , somnambulisms , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like slumberers in their beds ; the ever - rolling waves but made so by their restlessness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To any meditative Magian rover , this serene Pacific , once beheld , must ever after be the sea of his adoption ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It rolls the midmost waters of the world , the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The same waves wash the moles of the new - built Californian towns , but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men , and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands , older than Abraham ; while all between float milky - ways of coral isles , and low - lying , endless , unknown Archipelagoes , and impenetrable Japans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thus this mysterious , divine Pacific zones the world ' s whole bulk about ; makes all coasts one bay to it ; seems the tide - beating heart of earth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lifted by those eternal swells , you needs must own the seductive god , bowing your head to Pan ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab ' s brain , as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging , with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles ( in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking ), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea ; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Launched at length upon these almost final waters , and gliding towards the Japanese cruising - ground , the old man ' s purpose intensified itself ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His firm lips met like the lips of a vice ; the Delta of his forehead ' s veins swelled like overladen brooks ; in his very sleep , his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull , &quot; Stern all !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the White Whale spouts thick blood !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 112" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Blacksmith ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Availing himself of the mild , summer - cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes , and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated , Perth , the begrimed , blistered old blacksmith , had not removed his portable forge to the hold again , after concluding his contributory work for Ahab ' s leg , but still retained it on deck , fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast ; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen , and harpooneers , and bowsmen to do some little job for them ; altering , or repairing , or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle , all waiting to be served ; holding boat - spades , pike - heads , harpoons , and lances , and jealously watching his every sooty movement , as he toiled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nevertheless , this old man ' s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No murmur , no impatience , no petulance did come from him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Silent , slow , and solemn ; bowing over still further his chronically broken back , he toiled away , as if toil were life itself , and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so it was .-- Most miserable !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A peculiar walk in this old man , a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait , had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in ; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Belated , and not innocently , one bitter winter ' s midnight , on the road running between two country towns , the blacksmith half - stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him , and sought refuge in a leaning , dilapidated barn ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The issue was , the loss of the extremities of both feet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Out of this revelation , part by part , at last came out the four acts of the gladness , and the one long , and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life ' s drama ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He was an old man , who , at the age of nearly sixty , had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow ' s technicals called ruin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He had been an artisan of famed excellence , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a youthful , daughter - like , loving wife , and three blithe , ruddy children ; every Sunday went to a cheerful - looking church , planted in a grove ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But one night , under cover of darkness , and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement , a desperate burglar slid into his happy home , and robbed them all of everything ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And darker yet to tell , the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family ' s heart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was the Bottle Conjuror !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon the opening of that fatal cork , forth flew the fiend , and shrivelled up his home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , for prudent , most wise , and economic reasons , the blacksmith ' s shop was in the basement of his dwelling , but with a separate entrance to it ; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness , but with vigorous pleasure , to the stout ringing of her young - armed old husband ' s hammer ; whose reverberations , muffled by passing through the floors and walls , came up to her , not unsweetly , in her nursery ; and so , to stout Labor ' s iron lullaby , the blacksmith ' s infants were rocked to slumber ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , woe on woe !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , Death , why canst thou not sometimes be timely ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him , then had the young widow had a delicious grief , and her orphans a truly venerable , legendary sire to dream of in their after years ; and all of them a care - killing competency ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother , on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family , and left the worse than useless old man standing , till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why tell the whole ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between ; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last ; the wife sat frozen at the window , with tearless eyes , glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children ; the bellows fell ; the forge choked up with cinders ; the house was sold ; the mother dived down into the long church - yard grass ; her children twice followed her thither ; and the houseless , familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape ; his every woe unreverenced ; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this ; but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried ; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote , the Wild , the Watery , the Unshored ; therefore , to the death - longing eyes of such men , who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide , does the all - contributed and all - receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable , taking terrors , and wonderful , new - life adventures ; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics , the thousand mermaids sing to them --&quot; Come hither , broken - hearted ; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death ; here are wonders supernatural , without dying for them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come hither !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="bury thyself in a life which , to your now equally abhorred and abhorring , landed world , is more oblivious than death ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come hither !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="put up THY gravestone , too , within the churchyard , and come hither , till we marry thee !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hearkening to these voices , East and West , by early sunrise , and by fall of eve , the blacksmith ' s soul responded , Aye , I come !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so Perth went a - whaling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 113" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Forge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With matted beard , and swathed in a bristling shark - skin apron , about mid - day , Perth was standing between his forge and anvil , the latter placed upon an iron - wood log , with one hand holding a pike - head in the coals , and with the other at his forge ' s lungs , when Captain Ahab came along , carrying in his hand a small rusty - looking leathern bag ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While yet a little distance from the forge , moody Ahab paused ; till at last , Perth , withdrawing his iron from the fire , began hammering it upon the anvil -- the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights , some of which flew close to Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Are these thy Mother Carey ' s chickens , Perth ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="they are always flying in thy wake ; birds of good omen , too , but not to all ;-- look here , they burn ; but thou -- thou liv ' st among them without a scorch .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Because I am scorched all over , Captain Ahab ,&quot; answered Perth , resting for a moment on his hammer ; &quot; I am past scorching ; not easily can ' st thou scorch a scar .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Well , well ; no more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly , sanely woeful to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In no Paradise myself , I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou should ' st go mad , blacksmith ; say , why dost thou not go mad ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How can ' st thou endure without being mad ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do the heavens yet hate thee , that thou can ' st not go mad ?-- What wert thou making there ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Welding an old pike - head , sir ; there were seams and dents in it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And can ' st thou make it all smooth again , blacksmith , after such hard usage as it had ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I think so , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And I suppose thou can ' st smoothe almost any seams and dents ; never mind how hard the metal , blacksmith ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , sir , I think I can ; all seams and dents but one .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look ye here , then ,&quot; cried Ahab , passionately advancing , and leaning with both hands on Perth ' s shoulders ; &quot; look ye here -- HERE -- can ye smoothe out a seam like this , blacksmith ,&quot; sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow ; &quot; if thou could ' st , blacksmith , glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil , and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Answer !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can ' st thou smoothe this seam ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that is the one , sir !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Said I not all seams and dents but one ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , blacksmith , it is the one ; aye , man , it is unsmoothable ; for though thou only see ' st it here in my flesh , it has worked down into the bone of my skull -- THAT is all wrinkles !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , away with child ' s play ; no more gaffs and pikes to - day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look ye here !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="jingling the leathern bag , as if it were full of gold coins ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I , too , want a harpoon made ; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part , Perth ; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin - bone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s the stuff ,&quot; flinging the pouch upon the anvil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look ye , blacksmith , these are the gathered nail - stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Horse - shoe stubbs , sir ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why , Captain Ahab , thou hast here , then , the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I know it , old man ; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Quick !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="forge me the harpoon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And forge me first , twelve rods for its shank ; then wind , and twist , and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow - line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Quick !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll blow the fire .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When at last the twelve rods were made , Ahab tried them , one by one , by spiralling them , with his own hand , round a long , heavy iron bolt ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; A flaw !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="rejecting the last one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Work that over again , Perth .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This done , Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one , when Ahab stayed his hand , and said he would weld his own iron ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As , then , with regular , gasping hems , he hammered on the anvil , Perth passing to him the glowing rods , one after the other , and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame , the Parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire , seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But , as Ahab looked up , he slid aside ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="muttered Stubb , looking on from the forecastle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; That Parsee smells fire like a fusee ; and smells of it himself , like a hot musket ' s powder - pan .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last the shank , in one complete rod , received its final heat ; and as Perth , to temper it , plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by , the scalding steam shot up into Ahab ' s bent face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Would ' st thou brand me , Perth ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="wincing for a moment with the pain ; &quot; have I been but forging my own branding - iron , then ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pray God , not that ; yet I fear something , Captain Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is not this harpoon for the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; For the white fiend !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But now for the barbs ; thou must make them thyself , man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here are my razors -- the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the needle - sleet of the Icy Sea .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a moment , the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Take them , man , I have no need for them ; for I now neither shave , sup , nor pray till -- but here -- to work !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape , and welded by Perth to the shank , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to tempering them , he cried to Ahab to place the water - cask near ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , no -- no water for that ; I want it of the true death - temper ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahoy , there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tashtego , Queequeg , Daggoo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What say ye , pagans !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="holding it high up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A cluster of dark nods replied , Yes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh , and the White Whale ' s barbs were then tempered ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris , sed in nomine diaboli !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="deliriously howled Ahab , as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , mustering the spare poles from below , and selecting one of hickory , with the bark still investing it , Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A coil of new tow - line was then unwound , and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass , and stretched to a great tension ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pressing his foot upon it , till the rope hummed like a harp - string , then eagerly bending over it , and seeing no strandings , Ahab exclaimed , &quot; Good !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and now for the seizings .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At one extremity the rope was unstranded , and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon ; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket ; from the lower end the rope was traced half - way along the pole ' s length , and firmly secured so , with intertwistings of twine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This done , pole , iron , and rope -- like the Three Fates -- remained inseparable , and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the hickory pole , both hollowly ringing along every plank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ere he entered his cabin , light , unnatural , half - bantering , yet most piteous sound was heard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , Pip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thy wretched laugh , thy idle but unresting eye ; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship , and mocked it !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Gilder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground , the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Often , in mild , pleasant weather , for twelve , fifteen , eighteen , and twenty hours on the stretch , they were engaged in the boats , steadily pulling , or sailing , or paddling after the whales , or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising ; though with but small success for their pains ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At such times , under an abated sun ; afloat all day upon smooth , slow heaving swells ; seated in his boat , light as a birch canoe ; and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves , that like hearth - stone cats they purr against the gunwale ; these are the times of dreamy quietude , when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean ' s skin , one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it ; and would not willingly remember , that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These are the times , when in his whale - boat the rover softly feels a certain filial , confident , land - like feeling towards the sea ; that he regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western emigrants ' horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The long - drawn virgin vales ; the mild blue hill - sides ; as over these there steals the hush , the hum ; you almost swear that play - wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes , in some glad May - time , when the flowers of the woods are plucked ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And all this mixes with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , half - way meeting , interpenetrate , and form one seamless whole ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor did such soothing scenes , however temporary , fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries , yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , grassy glades !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="oh , ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul ; in ye ,-- though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life ,-- in ye , men yet may roll , like young horses in new morning clover ; and for some few fleeting moments , feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Would to God these blessed calms would last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the mingled , mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof : calms crossed by storms , a storm for every calm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There is no steady unretracing progress in this life ; we do not advance through fixed gradations , and at the last one pause :-- through infancy ' s unconscious spell , boyhood ' s thoughtless faith , adolescence ' doubt ( the common doom ), then scepticism , then disbelief , resting at last in manhood ' s pondering repose of If ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But once gone through , we trace the round again ; and are infants , boys , and men , and Ifs eternally ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="And that same day , too , gazing far down from his boat ' s side into that same golden sea , Starbuck lowly murmured :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Loveliness unfathomable , as ever lover saw in his young bride ' s eye !-- Tell me not of thy teeth - tiered sharks , and thy kidnapping cannibal ways ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let faith oust fact ; let fancy oust memory ; I look deep down and do believe .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And Stubb , fish - like , with sparkling scales , leaped up in that same golden light :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I am Stubb , and Stubb has his history ; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 115" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pequod Meets The Bachelor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind , some few weeks after Ahab ' s harpoon had been welded ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a Nantucket ship , the Bachelor , which had just wedged in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad holiday apparel , was joyously , though somewhat vain - gloriously , sailing round among the widely - separated ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow for home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The three men at her mast - head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats ; from the stern , a whale - boat was suspended , bottom down ; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Signals , ensigns , and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging , on every side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm ; above which , in her top - mast cross - trees , you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid ; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As was afterwards learned , the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success ; all the more wonderful , for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm , but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for , from the ships she had met ; and these were stowed along the deck , and in the captain ' s and officers ' state - rooms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling - wood ; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil - butt , lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the forecastle , the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests , and filled them ; it was humorously added , that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler , and filled it ; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee - pot and filled it ; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them ; that indeed everything was filled with sperm , except the captain ' s pantaloons pockets , and those he reserved to thrust his hands into , in self - complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod , the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle ; and drawing still nearer , a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try - pots , which , covered with the parchment - like POKE or stomach skin of the black fish , gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On the quarter - deck , the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive - hued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles ; while suspended in an ornamented boat , firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast , three Long Island negroes , with glittering fiddle - bows of whale ivory , were presiding over the hilarious jig ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , others of the ship ' s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try - works , from which the huge pots had been removed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille , such wild cries they raised , as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lord and master over all this scene , the captain stood erect on the ship ' s elevated quarter - deck , so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him , and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And Ahab , he too was standing on his quarter - deck , shaggy and black , with a stubborn gloom ; and as the two ships crossed each other ' s wakes -- one all jubilations for things passed , the other all forebodings as to things to come -- their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Come aboard , come aboard !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the gay Bachelor ' s commander , lifting a glass and a bottle in the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hast seen the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="gritted Ahab in reply ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No ; only heard of him ; but don ' t believe in him at all ,&quot; said the other good - humoredly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Come aboard !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou art too damned jolly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sail on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hast lost any men ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Not enough to speak of -- two islanders , that ' s all ;-- but come aboard , old hearty , come along ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll soon take that black from your brow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come along , will ye ( merry ' s the play ); a full ship and homeward - bound .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; How wondrous familiar is a fool !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="muttered Ahab ; then aloud , &quot; Thou art a full ship and homeward bound , thou sayst ; well , then , call me an empty ship , and outward - bound ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So go thy ways , and I will mine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Forward there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Set all sail , and keep her to the wind !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus , while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze , the other stubbornly fought against it ; and so the two vessels parted ; the crew of the Pequod looking with grave , lingering glances towards the receding Bachelor ; but the Bachelor ' s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as Ahab , leaning over the taffrail , eyed the homewardbound craft , he took from his pocket a small vial of sand , and then looking from the ship to the vial , seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together , for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 116" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Dying Whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not seldom in this life , when , on the right side , fortune ' s favourites sail close by us , we , though all adroop before , catch somewhat of the rushing breeze , and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So seemed it with the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain ; and one of them by Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was far down the afternoon ; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done : and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky , sun and whale both stilly died together ; then , such a sweetness and such plaintiveness , such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air , that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles , the Spanish land - breeze , wantonly turned sailor , had gone to sea , freighted with these vesper hymns ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soothed again , but only soothed to deeper gloom , Ahab , who had sterned off from the whale , sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying -- the turning sunwards of the head , and so expiring -- that strange spectacle , beheld of such a placid evening , somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He turns and turns him to it ,-- how slowly , but how steadfastly , his homage - rendering and invoking brow , with his last dying motions ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He too worships fire ; most faithful , broad , baronial vassal of the sun !-- Oh that these too - favouring eyes should see these too - favouring sights ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="here , far water - locked ; beyond all hum of human weal or woe ; in these most candid and impartial seas ; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets ; where for long Chinese ages , the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to , as stars that shine upon the Niger ' s unknown source ; here , too , life dies sunwards full of faith ; but see !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="no sooner dead , than death whirls round the corpse , and it heads some other way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , thou dark Hindoo half of nature , who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas ; thou art an infidel , thou queen , and too truly speakest to me in the wide - slaughtering Typhoon , and the hushed burial of its after calm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head , and then gone round again , without a lesson to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , trebly hooped and welded hip of power !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , high aspiring , rainbowed jet !-- that one strivest , this one jettest all in vain !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In vain , oh whale , dost thou seek intercedings with yon all - quickening sun , that only calls forth life , but gives it not again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet dost thou , darker half , rock me with a prouder , if a darker faith ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here ; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things , exhaled as air , but water now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Then hail , for ever hail , O sea , in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Born of earth , yet suckled by the sea ; though hill and valley mothered me , ye billows are my foster - brothers !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 117" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Whale Watch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart ; one , far to windward ; one , less distant , to leeward ; one ahead ; one astern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall ; but the windward one could not be reached till morning ; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night ; and that boat was Ahab ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The waif - pole was thrust upright into the dead whale ' s spout - hole ; and the lantern hanging from its top , cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black , glossy back , and far out upon the midnight waves , which gently chafed the whale ' s broad flank , like soft surf upon a beach ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab and all his boat ' s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee ; who crouching in the bow , sat watching the sharks , that spectrally played round the whale , and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah , ran shuddering through the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Started from his slumbers , Ahab , face to face , saw the Parsee ; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I have dreamed it again ,&quot; said he ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Of the hearses ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Have I not said , old man , that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And who are hearsed that die on the sea ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But I said , old man , that ere thou couldst die on this voyage , two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea ; the first not made by mortal hands ; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a strange sight that , Parsee :-- a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall - bearers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such a sight we shall not soon see .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Believe it or not , thou canst not die till it be seen , old man .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And what was that saying about thyself ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Though it come to the last , I shall still go before thee thy pilot .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And when thou art so gone before -- if that ever befall -- then ere I can follow , thou must still appear to me , to pilot me still ?-- Was it not so ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , then , did I believe all ye say , oh my pilot !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Take another pledge , old man ,&quot; said the Parsee , as his eyes lighted up like fire - flies in the gloom --&quot; Hemp only can kill thee .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The gallows , ye mean .-- I am immortal then , on land and on sea ,&quot; cried Ahab , with a laugh of derision ;--&quot; Immortal on land and on sea !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Both were silent again , as one man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The grey dawn came on , and the slumbering crew arose from the boat ' s bottom , and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 118" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Quadrant ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The season for the Line at length drew near ; and every day when Ahab , coming from his cabin , cast his eyes aloft , the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes , and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces , and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon ; impatient for the order to point the ship ' s prow for the equator ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In good time the order came ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was hard upon high noon ; and Ahab , seated in the bows of his high - hoisted boat , was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , in that Japanese sea , the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean ' s immeasurable burning - glass ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sky looks lacquered ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God ' s throne ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well that Ahab ' s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses , through which to take sight of that solar fire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship , and with his astrological - looking instrument placed to his eye , he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed , the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship ' s deck , and with face thrown up like Ahab ' s , was eyeing the same sun with him ; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs , and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At length the desired observation was taken ; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg , Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then falling into a moment ' s revery , he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself : &quot; Thou sea - mark !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thou high and mighty Pilot !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thou tellest me truly where I AM -- but canst thou cast the least hint where I SHALL be ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where is Moby Dick ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This instant thou must be eyeing him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him ; aye , and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown , thither side of thee , thou sun !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then gazing at his quadrant , and handling , one after the other , its numerous cabalistical contrivances , he pondered again , and muttered : &quot; Foolish toy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="babies ' plaything of haughty Admirals , and Commodores , and Captains ; the world brags of thee , of thy cunning and might ; but what after all canst thou do , but tell the poor , pitiful point , where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet , and the hand that holds thee : no !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="not one jot more !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to - morrow noon ; and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Science !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Curse thee , thou vain toy ; and cursed be all the things that cast man ' s eyes aloft to that heaven , whose live vividness but scorches him , as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light , O sun !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Level by nature to this earth ' s horizon are the glances of man ' s eyes ; not shot from the crown of his head , as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Curse thee , thou quadrant !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="dashing it to the deck , &quot; no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee ; the level ship ' s compass , and the level deadreckoning , by log and by line ; THESE shall conduct me , and show me my place on the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye ,&quot; lighting from the boat to the deck , &quot; thus I trample on thee , thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high ; thus I split and destroy thee !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet , a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab , and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself -- these passed over the mute , motionless Parsee ' s face ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unobserved he rose and glided away ; while , awestruck by the aspect of their commander , the seamen clustered together on the forecastle , till Ahab , troubledly pacing the deck , shouted out --&quot; To the braces !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Up helm !-- square in !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In an instant the yards swung round ; and as the ship half - wheeled upon her heel , her three firm - seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long , ribbed hull , seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Standing between the knight - heads , Starbuck watched the Pequod ' s tumultuous way , and Ahab ' s also , as he went lurching along the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow , full of its tormented flaming life ; and I have seen it wane at last , down , down , to dumbest dust ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Old man of oceans !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="of all this fiery life of thine , what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye ,&quot; cried Stubb , &quot; but sea - coal ashes -- mind ye that , Mr . Starbuck -- sea - coal , not your common charcoal ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , well ; I heard Ahab mutter , ' Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine ; swears that I must play them , and no others .'" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And damn me , Ahab , but thou actest right ; live in the game , and die in it !&quot;" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="So , too , it is , that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms , the Typhoon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky , like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Towards evening of that day , the Pequod was torn of her canvas , and bare - poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly ahead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When darkness came on , sky and sea roared and split with the thunder , and blazed with the lightning , that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Holding by a shroud , Starbuck was standing on the quarter - deck ; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft , to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there ; while Stubb and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But all their pains seemed naught ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though lifted to the very top of the cranes , the windward quarter boat ( Ahab ' s ) did not escape ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A great rolling sea , dashing high up against the reeling ship ' s high teetering side , stove in the boat ' s bottom at the stern , and left it again , all dripping through like a sieve ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Bad work , bad work !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mr . Starbuck ,&quot; said Stubb , regarding the wreck , &quot; but the sea will have its way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb , for one , can ' t fight it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="You see , Mr . Starbuck , a wave has such a great long start before it leaps , all round the world it runs , and then comes the spring !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as for me , all the start I have to meet it , is just across the deck here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But never mind ; it ' s all in fun : so the old song says ;&quot;--( SINGS .)" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="jolly is the gale , And a joker is the whale , A ' flourishin ' his tail ,-- Such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the Ocean , oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The scud all a flyin ', That ' s his flip only foamin '; When he stirs in the spicin ',-- Such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the Ocean , oh !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Avast Stubb ,&quot; cried Starbuck , &quot; let the Typhoon sing , and strike his harp here in our rigging ; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But I am not a brave man ; never said I was a brave man ; I am a coward ; and I sing to keep up my spirits ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I tell you what it is , Mr . Starbuck , there ' s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And when that ' s done , ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind - up .&quot;" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else , never mind how foolish ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Here !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck , seizing Stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , &quot; markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the very course he swung to this day noon ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the stern - sheets , man ; where he is wont to stand -- his stand - point is stove , man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now jump overboard , and sing away , if thou must !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Yes , yes , round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket ,&quot; soliloquized Starbuck suddenly , heedless of Stubb ' s question ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yonder , to windward , all is blackness of doom ; but to leeward , homeward -- I see it lightens up there ; but not with the lightning .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness , following the flashes , a voice was heard at his side ; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Who ' s there ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Old Thunder !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="said Ahab , groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot - hole ; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil ; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast , is intended to conduct it into the water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth , that its end may avoid all contact with the hull ; and as moreover , if kept constantly towing there , it would be liable to many mishaps , besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging , and more or less impeding the vessel ' s way in the water ; because of all this , the lower parts of a ship ' s lightning - rods are not always overboard ; but are generally made in long slender links , so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside , or thrown down into the sea , as occasion may require ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The rods !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the rods !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck to the crew , suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux , to light Ahab to his post ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Are they overboard ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="drop them over , fore and aft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Quick !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Avast !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab ; &quot; let ' s have fair play here , though we be the weaker side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet I ' ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes , that all the world may be secured ; but out on privileges !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let them be , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look aloft !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The corpusants !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the corpusants !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All the yard - arms were tipped with a pallid fire ; and touched at each tri - pointed lightning - rod - end with three tapering white flames , each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air , like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Blast the boat !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="let it go !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb at this instant , as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft , so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand , as he was passing a lashing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Blast it !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- but slipping backward on the deck , his uplifted eyes caught the flames ; and immediately shifting his tone he cried --&quot; The corpusants have mercy on us all !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To sailors , oaths are household words ; they will swear in the trance of the calm , and in the teeth of the tempest ; they will imprecate curses from the topsail - yard - arms , when most they teeter over to a seething sea ; but in all my voyagings , seldom have I heard a common oath when God ' s burning finger has been laid on the ship ; when His &quot; Mene , Mene , Tekel Upharsin &quot; has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While this pallidness was burning aloft , few words were heard from the enchanted crew ; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle , all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence , like a far away constellation of stars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Relieved against the ghostly light , the gigantic jet negro , Daggoo , loomed up to thrice his real stature , and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark - white teeth , which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants ; while lit up by the preternatural light , Queequeg ' s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft ; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A moment or two passed , when Starbuck , going forward , pushed against some one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What thinkest thou now , man ; I heard thy cry ; it was not the same in the song .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; No , no , it wasn ' t ; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all ; and I hope they will , still ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But do they only have mercy on long faces ?-- have they no bowels for a laugh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And look ye , Mr . Starbuck -- but it ' s too dark to look ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hear me , then : I take that mast - head flame we saw for a sign of good luck ; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a ' block with sperm - oil , d ' ye see ; and so , all that sperm will work up into the masts , like sap in a tree ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles -- that ' s the good promise we saw .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb ' s face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Glancing upwards , he cried : &quot; See !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="see !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The corpusants have mercy on us all ,&quot; cried Stubb , again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the base of the mainmast , full beneath the doubloon and the flame , the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab ' s front , but with his head bowed away from him ; while near by , from the arched and overhanging rigging , where they had just been engaged securing a spar , a number of the seamen , arrested by the glare , now cohered together , and hung pendulous , like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping , orchard twig ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In various enchanted attitudes , like the standing , or stepping , or running skeletons in Herculaneum , others remained rooted to the deck ; but all their eyes upcast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye , men !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look up at it ; mark it well ; the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hand me those mainmast links there ; I would fain feel this pulse , and let mine beat against it ; blood against fire !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then turning -- the last link held fast in his left hand , he put his foot upon the Parsee ; and with fixed upward eye , and high - flung right arm , he stood erect before the lofty tri - pointed trinity of flames ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thou clear spirit of clear fire , whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship , till in the sacramental act so burned by thee , that to this hour I bear the scar ; I now know thee , thou clear spirit , and I now know that thy right worship is defiance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind ; and e ' en for hate thou canst but kill ; and all are killed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No fearless fool now fronts thee ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I own thy speechless , placeless power ; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional , unintegral mastery in me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the midst of the personified impersonal , a personality stands here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though but a point at best ; whencesoe ' er I came ; wheresoe ' er I go ; yet while I earthly live , the queenly personality lives in me , and feels her royal rights ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But war is pain , and hate is woe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come in thy lowest form of love , and I will kneel and kiss thee ; but at thy highest , come as mere supernal power ; and though thou launchest navies of full - freighted worlds , there ' s that in here that still remains indifferent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , thou clear spirit , of thy fire thou madest me , and like a true child of fire , I breathe it back to thee .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="[ SUDDEN , REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING ; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT ; AHAB , WITH THE REST , CLOSES HIS EYES , HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM .]" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Nor was it wrung from me ; nor do I now drop these links ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou canst blind ; but I can then grope ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Take the homage of these poor eyes , and shutter - hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I would not take it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The lightning flashes through my skull ; mine eye - balls ache and ache ; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded , and rolling on some stunning ground ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Oh , thou magnanimous !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="now I do glory in my genealogy ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="what hast thou done with her ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There lies my puzzle ; but thine is greater ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou knowest not how came ye , hence callest thyself unbegotten ; certainly knowest not thy beginning , hence callest thyself unbegun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I know that of me , which thou knowest not of thyself , oh , thou omnipotent ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Oh , thou foundling fire , thou hermit immemorial , thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle , thy unparticipated grief ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here again with haughty agony , I read my sire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Leap !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="leap up , and lick the sky !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I leap with thee ; I burn with thee ; would fain be welded with thee ; defyingly I worship thee !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The boat !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the boat !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Starbuck , &quot; look at thy boat , old man !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab ' s harpoon , the one forged at Perth ' s fire , remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch , so that it projected beyond his whale - boat ' s bow ; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off ; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale , forked fire ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent ' s tongue , Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm --&quot; God , God is against thee , old man ; forbear !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' tis an ill voyage !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ill begun , ill continued ; let me square the yards , while we may , old man , and make a fair wind of it homewards , to go on a better voyage than this .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Overhearing Starbuck , the panic - stricken crew instantly ran to the braces -- though not a sail was left aloft ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For the moment all the aghast mate ' s thoughts seemed theirs ; they raised a half mutinous cry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck , and snatching the burning harpoon , Ahab waved it like a torch among them ; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope ' s end ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Petrified by his aspect , and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held , the men fell back in dismay , and Ahab again spoke :--" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old Ahab is bound ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats ; look ye here ; thus I blow out the last fear !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain , men fly the neighborhood of some lone , gigantic elm , whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe , because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts ; so at those last words of Ahab ' s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Didn ' t you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in , that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy , just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Well , suppose I did ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What then ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ve part changed my flesh since that time , why not my mind ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Shake yourself ; you ' re Aquarius , or the water - bearer , Flask ; might fill pitchers at your coat collar ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Here are hydrants , Flask ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But hark , again , and I ' ll answer ye the other thing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here , though , so I can pass the rope ; now listen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s the mighty difference between holding a mast ' s lightning - rod in the storm , and standing close by a mast that hasn ' t got any lightning - rod at all in a storm ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="What are you talking about , then ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not one ship in a hundred carries rods , and Ahab ,-- aye , man , and all of us ,-- were in no more danger then , in my poor opinion , than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="any man with half an eye can be sensible .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I don ' t know that , Stubb ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Yes , when a fellow ' s soaked through , it ' s hard to be sensible , that ' s a fact ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And I am about drenched with this spray ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Never mind ; catch the turn there , and pass it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tying these two anchors here , Flask , seems like tying a man ' s hands behind him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And what big generous hands they are , to be sure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These are your iron fists , hey ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What a hold they have , too !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I wonder , Flask , whether the world is anchored anywhere ; if she is , she swings with an uncommon long cable , though ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon , the man at the Pequod ' s jaw - bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions , even though preventer tackles had been attached to it -- for they were slack -- because some play to the tiller was indispensable ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In a severe gale like this , while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast , it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses , at intervals , go round and round ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was thus with the Pequod ' s ; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards ; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some hours after midnight , the Typhoon abated so much , that through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb -- one engaged forward and the other aft -- the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main - top - sails were cut adrift from the spars , and went eddying away to leeward , like the feathers of an albatross , which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm - tossed bird is on the wing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed , and a storm - trysail was set further aft ; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again ; and the course -- for the present , East - south - east -- which he was to steer , if practicable , was once more given to the helmsman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="In compliance with the standing order of his commander -- to report immediately , and at any one of the twenty - four hours , any decided change in the affairs of the deck ,-- Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze -- however reluctantly and gloomily ,-- than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ere knocking at his state - room , he involuntarily paused before it a moment ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The cabin lamp -- taking long swings this way and that -- was burning fitfully , and casting fitful shadows upon the old man ' s bolted door ,-- a thin one , with fixed blinds inserted , in place of upper panels ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; He would have shot me once ,&quot; he murmured , &quot; yes , there ' s the very musket that he pointed at me ;-- that one with the studded stock ; let me touch it -- lift it ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="If , then , he were this instant -- put aside , that crime would not be his ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="is he muttering in his sleep ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yes , just there ,-- in there , he ' s sleeping ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sleeping ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="aye , but still alive , and soon awake again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I can ' t withstand thee , then , old man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not reasoning ; not remonstrance ; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to ; all this thou scornest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Flat obedience to thy own flat commands , this is all thou breathest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , and say ' st the men have vow ' d thy vow ; say ' st all of us are Ahabs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Great God forbid !-- But is there no other way ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="no lawful way ?-- Make him a prisoner to be taken home ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="hope to wrest this old man ' s living power from his own living hands ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only a fool would try it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Say he were pinioned even ; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers ; chained down to ring - bolts on this cabin floor ; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger , then ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I could not endure the sight ; could not possibly fly his howlings ; all comfort , sleep itself , inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What , then , remains ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The land is hundreds of leagues away , and locked Japan the nearest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I stand alone here upon an open sea , with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law .-- Aye , aye , ' tis so .-- Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would - be murderer in his bed , tindering sheets and skin together ?-- And would I be a murderer , then , if &quot;-- and slowly , stealthily , and half sideways looking , he placed the loaded musket ' s end against the door ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; On this level , Ahab ' s hammock swings within ; his head this way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A touch , and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again .-- Oh Mary !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mary !-- boy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="boy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="boy !-- But if I wake thee not to death , old man , who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck ' s body this day week may sink , with all the crew !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Great God , where art Thou ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shall I ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="shall I ?-- The wind has gone down and shifted , sir ; the fore and main topsails are reefed and set ; she heads her course .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stern all !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh Moby Dick , I clutch thy heart at last !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man ' s tormented sleep , as if Starbuck ' s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard ' s arm against the panel ; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel ; but turning from the door , he placed the death - tube in its rack , and left the place ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' s too sound asleep , Mr . Stubb ; go thou down , and wake him , and tell him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I must see to the deck here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou know ' st what to say .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 124" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Needle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next morning the not - yet - subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk , and striving in the Pequod ' s gurgling track , pushed her on like giants ' palms outspread ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The strong , unstaggering breeze abounded so , that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails ; the whole world boomed before the wind ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Muffled in the full morning light , the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place ; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Emblazonings , as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens , reigned over everything ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sea was as a crucible of molten gold , that bubblingly leaps with light and heat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Long maintaining an enchanted silence , Ahab stood apart ; and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit , he turned to eye the bright sun ' s rays produced ahead ; and when she profoundly settled by the stern , he turned behind , and saw the sun ' s rearward place , and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ha , ha , my ship !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thou mightest well be taken now for the sea - chariot of the sun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ho , ho !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="all ye nations before my prow , I bring the sun to ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yoke on the further billows ; hallo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a tandem , I drive the sea !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But suddenly reined back by some counter thought , he hurried towards the helm , huskily demanding how the ship was heading ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; East - sou - east , sir ,&quot; said the frightened steersman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou liest !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="smiting him with his clenched fist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Heading East at this hour in the morning , and the sun astern ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon this every soul was confounded ; for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else ; but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle , Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses ; his uplifted arm slowly fell ; for a moment he almost seemed to stagger ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Standing behind him Starbuck looked , and lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the two compasses pointed East , and the Pequod was as infallibly going West ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed , &quot; I have it !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It has happened before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mr . Starbuck , last night ' s thunder turned our compasses -- that ' s all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou hast before now heard of such a thing , I take it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye ; but never before has it happened to me , sir ,&quot; said the pale mate , gloomily ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , it must needs be said , that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The magnetic energy , as developed in the mariner ' s needle , is , as all know , essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven ; hence it is not to be much marvelled at , that such things should be ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel , so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging , the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal ; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated , so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife ' s knitting needle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in either case , the needle never again , of itself , recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost ; and if the binnacle compasses be affected , the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship ; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Deliberately standing before the binnacle , and eyeing the transpointed compasses , the old man , with the sharp of his extended hand , now took the precise bearing of the sun , and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted , shouted out his orders for the ship ' s course to be changed accordingly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The yards were hard up ; and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind , for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile , whatever were his own secret thoughts , Starbuck said nothing , but quietly he issued all requisite orders ; while Stubb and Flask -- who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings -- likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As for the men , though some of them lowly rumbled , their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as ever before , the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed ; or if impressed , it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But chancing to slip with his ivory heel , he saw the crushed copper sight - tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Thou poor , proud heaven - gazer and sun ' s pilot !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="yesterday I wrecked thee , and to - day the compasses would fain have wrecked me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mr . Starbuck -- a lance without a pole ; a top - maul , and the smallest of the sail - maker ' s needles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Quick !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Accessory , perhaps , to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do , were certain prudential motives , whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill , in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Besides , the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles , though clumsily practicable , was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors , without some shudderings and evil portents ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Men ,&quot; said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate handed him the things he had demanded , &quot; my men , the thunder turned old Ahab ' s needles ; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own , that will point as true as any .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors , as this was said ; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Starbuck looked away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With a blow from the top - maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance , and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining , bade him hold it upright , without its touching the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , with the maul , after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod , he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it , and less strongly hammered that , several times , the mate still holding the rod as before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then going through some small strange motions with it -- whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel , or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew , is uncertain -- he called for linen thread ; and moving to the binnacle , slipped out the two reversed needles there , and horizontally suspended the sail - needle by its middle , over one of the compass - cards ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At first , the steel went round and round , quivering and vibrating at either end ; but at last it settled to its place , when Ahab , who had been intently watching for this result , stepped frankly back from the binnacle , and pointing his stretched arm towards it , exclaimed ,--&quot; Look ye , for yourselves , if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sun is East , and that compass swears it !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One after another they peered in , for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs , and one after another they slunk away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph , you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 125" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Log and Line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage , the log and line had but very seldom been in use ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel ' s place , some merchantmen , and many whalemen , especially when cruising , wholly neglect to heave the log ; though at the same time , and frequently more for form ' s sake than anything else , regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship , as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It had been thus with the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The wooden reel and angular log attached hung , long untouched , just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Rains and spray had damped it ; sun and wind had warped it ; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But heedless of all this , his mood seized Ahab , as he happened to glance upon the reel , not many hours after the magnet scene , and he remembered how his quadrant was no more , and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship was sailing plungingly ; astern the billows rolled in riots ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Forward , there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Heave the log !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Two seamen came ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The golden - hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Take the reel , one of ye , I ' ll heave .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They went towards the extreme stern , on the ship ' s lee side , where the deck , with the oblique energy of the wind , was now almost dipping into the creamy , sidelong - rushing sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Manxman took the reel , and holding it high up , by the projecting handle - ends of the spindle , round which the spool of line revolved , so stood with the angular log hanging downwards , till Ahab advanced to him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab stood before him , and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand - coil to toss overboard , when the old Manxman , who was intently eyeing both him and the line , made bold to speak ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sir , I mistrust it ; this line looks far gone , long heat and wet have spoiled it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Twill hold , old gentleman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Long heat and wet , have they spoiled thee ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou seem ' st to hold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Or , truer perhaps , life holds thee ; not thou it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I hold the spool , sir ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But just as my captain says ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With these grey hairs of mine ' tis not worth while disputing , ' specially with a superior , who ' ll ne ' er confess .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s that ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There now ' s a patched professor in Queen Nature ' s granite - founded College ; but methinks he ' s too subservient ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where wert thou born ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In the little rocky Isle of Man , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Excellent !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou ' st hit the world by that .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I know not , sir , but I was born there .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In the Isle of Man , hey ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Well , the other way , it ' s good ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here ' s a man from Man ; a man born in once independent Man , and now unmanned of Man ; which is sucked in -- by what ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Up with the reel !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The dead , blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Up with it !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The log was heaved ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern , and then , instantly , the reel began to whirl ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In turn , jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows , the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hold hard !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Snap !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon ; the tugging log was gone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad sea parts the log - line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Ahab can mend all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Haul in here , Tahitian ; reel up , Manxman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and mend thou the line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See to it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There he goes now ; to him nothing ' s happened ; but to me , the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Haul in , haul in , Tahitian !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and dragging slow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha , Pip ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="come to help ; eh , Pip ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Pip ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="whom call ye Pip ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pip jumped from the whale - boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pip ' s missing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let ' s see now if ye haven ' t fished him up here , fisherman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It drags hard ; I guess he ' s holding on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jerk him , Tahiti !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Jerk him off ; we haul in no cowards here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ho !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there ' s his arm just breaking water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A hatchet !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a hatchet !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cut it off -- we haul in no cowards here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Captain Ahab !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="sir , sir !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="here ' s Pip , trying to get on board again .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Peace , thou crazy loon ,&quot; cried the Manxman , seizing him by the arm ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Away from the quarter - deck !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser ,&quot; muttered Ahab , advancing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hands off from that holiness !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where sayest thou Pip was , boy ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Astern there , sir , astern !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="lo !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And who art thou , boy ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who art thou , boy ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Bell - boy , sir ; ship ' s - crier ; ding , dong , ding !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip ; five feet high -- looks cowardly -- quickest known by that !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ding , dong , ding !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who ' s seen Pip the coward ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There can be no hearts above the snow - line ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , ye frozen heavens !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="look down here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ye did beget this luckless child , and have abandoned him , ye creative libertines ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , boy ; Ahab ' s cabin shall be Pip ' s home henceforth , while Ahab lives ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thou touchest my inmost centre , boy ; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart - strings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come , let ' s down .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What ' s this ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="here ' s velvet shark - skin ,&quot; intently gazing at Ahab ' s hand , and feeling it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ah , now , had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this , perhaps he had ne ' er been lost !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This seems to me , sir , as a man - rope ; something that weak souls may hold by ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , sir , let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together ; the black one with the white , for I will not let this go .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , boy , nor will I thee , unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come , then , to my cabin ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lo !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ye believers in gods all goodness , and in man all ill , lo you !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man ; and man , though idiotic , and knowing not what he does , yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand , than though I grasped an Emperor ' s !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There go two daft ones now ,&quot; muttered the old Manxman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; One daft with strength , the other daft with weakness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But here ' s the end of the rotten line -- all dripping , too ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mend it , eh ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I think we had best have a new line altogether ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll see Mr . Stubb about it .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 126" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Life - Buoy ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Steering now south - eastward by Ahab ' s levelled steel , and her progress solely determined by Ahab ' s level log and line ; the Pequod held on her path towards the Equator ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters , descrying no ships , and ere long , sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds , over waves monotonously mild ; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last , when the ship drew near to the outskirts , as it were , of the Equatorial fishing - ground , and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn , was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets ; the watch -- then headed by Flask -- was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly -- like half - articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod ' s murdered Innocents -- that one and all , they started from their reveries , and for the space of some moments stood , or sat , or leaned all transfixedly listening , like the carved Roman slave , while that wild cry remained within hearing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids , and shuddered ; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet the grey Manxman -- the oldest mariner of all -- declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard , were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Below in his hammock , Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn , when he came to the deck ; it was then recounted to him by Flask , not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He hollowly laughed , and thus explained the wonder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals , and some young seals that had lost their dams , or some dams that had lost their cubs , must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her , crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this only the more affected some of them , because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals , arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress , but also from the human look of their round heads and semi - intelligent faces , seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the sea , under certain circumstances , seals have more than once been mistaken for men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At sun - rise this man went from his hammock to his mast - head at the fore ; and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep ( for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state ), whether it was thus with the man , there is now no telling ; but , be that as it may , he had not been long at his perch , when a cry was heard -- a cry and a rushing -- and looking up , they saw a falling phantom in the air ; and looking down , a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The life - buoy -- a long slender cask -- was dropped from the stern , where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring ; but no hand rose to seize it , and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken , so that it slowly filled , and that parched wood also filled at its every pore ; and the studded iron - bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom , as if to yield him his pillow , though in sooth but a hard one ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="The Pequod Meets The Rachel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next day , a large ship , the Rachel , was descried , bearing directly down upon the Pequod , all her spars thickly clustering with men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water ; but as the broad - winged windward stranger shot nigh to her , the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst , and all life fled from the smitten hull ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Bad news ; she brings bad news ,&quot; muttered the old Manxman ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ere her commander , who , with trumpet to mouth , stood up in his boat ; ere he could hopefully hail , Ahab ' s voice was heard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hast seen the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , yesterday ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Have ye seen a whale - boat adrift ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Throttling his joy , Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question ; and would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain himself , having stopped his vessel ' s way , was seen descending her side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A few keen pulls , and his boat - hook soon clinched the Pequod ' s main - chains , and he sprang to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no formal salutation was exchanged ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Where was he ?-- not killed !-- not killed !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , closely advancing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; How was it ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous , while three of the stranger ' s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales , which had led them some four or five miles from the ship ; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward , the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water , not very far to leeward ; whereupon , the fourth rigged boat -- a reserved one -- had been instantly lowered in chase ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="After a keen sail before the wind , this fourth boat -- the swiftest keeled of all -- seemed to have succeeded in fastening -- at least , as well as the man at the mast - head could tell anything about it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat ; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water ; and after that nothing more ; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers , as often happens ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There was some apprehension , but no positive alarm , as yet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The recall signals were placed in the rigging ; darkness came on ; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats -- ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction -- the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight , but , for the time , to increase her distance from it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard , she crowded all sail -- stunsail on stunsail -- after the missing boat ; kindling a fire in her try - pots for a beacon ; and every other man aloft on the look - out ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen ; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her ; and not finding anything , had again dashed on ; again paused , and lowered her boats ; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight ; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The story told , the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the Pequod ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I will wager something now ,&quot; whispered Stubb to Flask , &quot; that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captain ' s best coat ; mayhap , his watch -- he ' s so cursed anxious to get it back ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who ever heard of two pious whale - ships cruising after one missing whale - boat in the height of the whaling season ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See , Flask , only see how pale he looks -- pale in the very buttons of his eyes -- look -- it wasn ' t the coat -- it must have been the --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; My boy , my own boy is among them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For God ' s sake -- I beg , I conjure &quot;-- here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab , who thus far had but icily received his petition ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; For eight - and - forty hours let me charter your ship -- I will gladly pay for it , and roundly pay for it -- if there be no other way -- for eight - and - forty hours only -- only that -- you must , oh , you must , and you SHALL do this thing .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; His son !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb , &quot; oh , it ' s his son he ' s lost !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I take back the coat and watch -- what says Ahab ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We must save that boy .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' s drowned with the rest on ' em , last night ,&quot; said the old Manx sailor standing behind them ; &quot; I heard ; all of ye heard their spirits .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , as it shortly turned out , what made this incident of the Rachel ' s the more melancholy , was the circumstance , that not only was one of the Captain ' s sons among the number of the missing boat ' s crew ; but among the number of the other boat ' s crews , at the same time , but on the other hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity ; which was only solved for him by his chief mate ' s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale - ship in such emergencies , that is , when placed between jeopardized but divided boats , always to pick up the majority first ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the captain , for some unknown constitutional reason , had refrained from mentioning all this , and not till forced to it by Ahab ' s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy ; a little lad , but twelve years old , whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer ' s paternal love , had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor does it unfrequently occur , that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them , for a protracted three or four years ' voyage in some other ship than their own ; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman ' s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father ' s natural but untimely partiality , or undue apprehensiveness and concern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab ; and Ahab still stood like an anvil , receiving every shock , but without the least quivering of his own ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I will not go ,&quot; said the stranger , &quot; till you say aye to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For YOU too have a boy , Captain Ahab -- though but a child , and nestling safely at home now -- a child of your old age too -- Yes , yes , you relent ; I see it -- run , run , men , now , and stand by to square in the yards .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Avast ,&quot; cried Ahab --&quot; touch not a rope - yarn &quot;; then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word --&quot; Captain Gardiner , I will not do it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even now I lose time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Good - bye , good - bye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="God bless ye , man , and may I forgive myself , but I must go ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mr . Starbuck , look at the binnacle watch , and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers : then brace forward again , and let the ship sail as before .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hurriedly turning , with averted face , he descended into his cabin , leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But starting from his enchantment , Gardiner silently hurried to the side ; more fell than stepped into his boat , and returned to his ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon the two ships diverged their wakes ; and long as the strange vessel was in view , she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot , however small , on the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This way and that her yards were swung round ; starboard and larboard , she continued to tack ; now she beat against a head sea ; and again it pushed her before it ; while all the while , her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men , as three tall cherry trees , when the boys are cherrying among the boughs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But by her still halting course and winding , woeful way , you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray , still remained without comfort ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She was Rachel , weeping for her children , because they were not ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Thy hand !-- Met !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="True art thou , lad , as the circumference to its centre ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So : God for ever bless thee ; and if it come to that ,-- God for ever save thee , let what will befall .&quot;" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; Here he this instant stood ; I stand in his air ,-- but I ' m alone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it , but he ' s missing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pip !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ding , dong , ding !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Who ' s seen Pip ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He must be up here ; let ' s try the door ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="neither lock , nor bolt , nor bar ; and yet there ' s no opening it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It must be the spell ; he told me to stay here : Aye , and told me this screwed chair was mine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , then , I ' ll seat me , against the transom , in the ship ' s full middle , all her keel and her three masts before me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , our old sailors say , in their black seventy - fours great admirals sometimes sit at table , and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="What an odd feeling , now , when a black boy ' s host to white men with gold lace upon their coats !-- Monsieurs , have ye seen one Pip ?-- a little negro lad , five feet high , hang - dog look , and cowardly !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="CHAPTER 130" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Hat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now that at the proper time and place , after so long and wide a preliminary cruise , Ahab ,-- all other whaling waters swept -- seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean - fold , to slay him the more securely there ; now , that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted ; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick ;-- and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters , whether sinning or sinned against ; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man ' s eyes , which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As the unsetting polar star , which through the livelong , arctic , six months ' night sustains its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so Ahab ' s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It domineered above them so , that all their bodings , doubts , misgivings , fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this foreshadowing interval too , all humor , forced or natural , vanished ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb no more strove to raise a smile ; Starbuck no more strove to check one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Alike , joy and sorrow , hope and fear , seemed ground to finest dust , and powdered , for the time , in the clamped mortar of Ahab ' s iron soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like machines , they dumbly moved about the deck , ever conscious that the old man ' s despot eye was on them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours ; when he thought no glance but one was on him ; then you would have seen that even as Ahab ' s eyes so awed the crew ' s , the inscrutable Parsee ' s glance awed his ; or somehow , at least , in some wild way , at times affected it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such an added , gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now ; such ceaseless shudderings shook him ; that the men looked dubious at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being ' s body ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And that shadow was always hovering there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For not by night , even , had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber , or go below ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say -- We two watchmen never rest ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless Ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits ,-- the main - mast and the mizen ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin - scuttle ,-- his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat , they could never tell unerringly whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently scanning them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the unheeded night - damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone - carved coat and hat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The clothes that the night had wet , the next day ' s sunshine dried upon him ; and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ate in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals ,-- breakfast and dinner : supper he never touched ; nor reaped his beard ; which darkly grew all gnarled , as unearthed roots of trees blown over , which still grow idly on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the Parsee ' s mystic watch was without intermission as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak -- one man to the other -- unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe - struck crew , they seemed pole - like asunder ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At times , for longest hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the starlight ; Ahab in his scuttle , the Parsee by the mainmast ; but still fixedly gazing upon each other ; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow , in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yet , somehow , did Ahab -- in his own proper self , as daily , hourly , and every instant , commandingly revealed to his subordinates ,-- Ahab seemed an independent lord ; the Parsee but his slave ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Still again both seemed yoked together , and an unseen tyrant driving them ; the lean shade siding the solid rib ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For be this Parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft ,--&quot; Man the mast - heads !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman ' s bell , was heard --&quot; What d ' ye see ?-- sharp !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="sharp !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when three or four days had slided by , after meeting the children - seeking Rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew ' s fidelity ; at least , of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But if these suspicions were really his , he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them , however his actions might seem to hint them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I will have the first sight of the whale myself ,&quot;-- he said ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab must have the doubloon !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single sheaved block , to secure to the main - mast head , he received the two ends of the downward - reeved rope ; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo , Queequeg , Tashtego ; but shunning Fedallah ; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate , said ,--&quot; Take the rope , sir -- I give it into thy hands , Starbuck .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then arranging his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles ,-- ahead , astern , this side , and that ,-- within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no foothold , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and sustained there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Because in such a wilderness of running rigging , whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the deck - ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings , it would be but a natural fatality , if , unprovided with a constant watchman , the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So Ahab ' s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that Starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision -- one of those too , whose faithfulness on the look - out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ;-- it was strange , that this was the very man he should select for his watchman ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person ' s hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , the first time Ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten minutes ; one of those red - billed savage sea - hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast - heads of whalemen in these latitudes ; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then spiralized downwards , and went eddying again round his head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Your hat , your hat , sir !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman , who being posted at the mizen - mast - head , stood directly behind Ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But already the sable wing was before the old man ' s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin ' s head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon Tanaquil , his wife , declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab ' s hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 131" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pequod Meets The Delight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The intense Pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the life - buoy - coffin still lightly swung ; and another ship , most miserably misnamed the Delight , was descried ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called shears , which , in some whaling - ships , cross the quarter - deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; serving to carry the spare , unrigged , or disabled boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon the stranger ' s shears were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale - boat ; but you now saw through this wreck , as plainly as you see through the peeled , half - unhinged , and bleaching skeleton of a horse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hast seen the White Whale ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Look !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="replied the hollow - cheeked captain from his taffrail ; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Hast killed him ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that ,&quot; answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Not forged !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and snatching Perth ' s levelled iron from the crotch , Ahab held it out , exclaiming --&quot; Look ye , Nantucketer ; here in this hand I hold his death !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tempered in blood , and tempered by lightning are these barbs ; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin , where the White Whale most feels his accursed life !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Then God keep thee , old man -- see ' st thou that &quot;-- pointing to the hammock --&quot; I bury but one of five stout men , who were alive only yesterday ; but were dead ere night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only THAT one I bury ; the rest were buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then turning to his crew --&quot; Are ye ready there ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="place the plank then on the rail , and lift the body ; so , then -- Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="God &quot;-- advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands --&quot; may the resurrection and the life --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Brace forward !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Up helm !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab like lightning to his men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea ; not so quick , indeed , but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight , the strange life - buoy hanging at the Pequod ' s stern came into conspicuous relief ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="yonder !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="look yonder , men !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried a foreboding voice in her wake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad burial ; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 132" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Symphony ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was a clear steel - blue day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all - pervading azure ; only , the pensive air was transparently pure and soft , with a woman ' s look , and the robust and man - like sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as Samson ' s chest in his sleep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hither , and thither , on high , glided the snow - white wings of small , unspeckled birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air ; but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed mighty leviathans , sword - fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , troubled , murderous thinkings of the masculine sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the sex , as it were , that distinguished them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aloft , like a royal czar and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as bride to groom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And at the girdling line of the horizon , a soft and tremulous motion -- most seen here at the Equator -- denoted the fond , throbbing trust , the loving alarms , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Tied up and twisted ; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles ; haggardly firm and unyielding ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still glow in the ashes of ruin ; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn ; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl ' s forehead of heaven ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , immortal infancy , and innocency of the azure !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sweet childhood of air and sky !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how oblivious were ye of old Ahab ' s close - coiled woe !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha , laughing - eyed elves , heedlessly gambol around their old sire ; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt - out crater of his brain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle , Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel , for a moment , the cankerous thing in his soul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That glad , happy air , that winsome sky , did at last stroke and caress him ; the step - mother world , so long cruel -- forbidding -- now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , and did seem to joyously sob over him , as if over one , that however wilful and erring , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Starbuck saw the old man ; saw him , how he heavily leaned over the side ; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Careful not to touch him , or be noticed by him , he yet drew near to him , and stood there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab turned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Starbuck !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , Starbuck !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On such a day -- very much such a sweetness as this -- I struck my first whale -- a boy - harpooneer of eighteen !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Forty -- forty -- forty years ago !-- ago !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Forty years of continual whaling !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="forty years of privation , and peril , and storm - time !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="forty years on the pitiless sea !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye and yes , Starbuck , out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When I think of this life I have led ; the desolation of solitude it has been ; the masoned , walled - town of a Captain ' s exclusiveness , which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without -- oh , weariness !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="heaviness !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Guinea - coast slavery of solitary command !-- when I think of all this ; only half - suspected , not so keenly known to me before -- and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare -- fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil !-- when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand , and broken the world ' s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts -- away , whole oceans away , from that young girl - wife I wedded past fifty , and sailed for Cape Horn the next day , leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow -- wife ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="wife ?-- rather a widow with her husband alive !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , I widowed that poor girl when I married her , Starbuck ; and then , the madness , the frenzy , the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which , for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously , foamingly chased his prey -- more a demon than a man !-- aye , aye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what a forty years ' fool -- fool -- old fool , has old Ahab been !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why this strife of the chase ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="why weary , and palsy the arm at the oar , and the iron , and the lance ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how the richer or better is Ahab now ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Behold ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , Starbuck !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="is it not hard , that with this weary load I bear , one poor leg should have been snatched from under me ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here , brush this old hair aside ; it blinds me , that I seem to weep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But do I look very old , so very , very old , Starbuck ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I feel deadly faint , bowed , and humped , as though I were Adam , staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="God !-- crack my heart !-- stave my brain !-- mockery !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="mockery !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="bitter , biting mockery of grey hairs , have I lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus intolerably old ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Close !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="stand close to me , Starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon God ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By the green land ; by the bright hearth - stone !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="this is the magic glass , man ; I see my wife and my child in thine eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , no ; stay on board , on board !-- lower not when I do ; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That hazard shall not be thine ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , no !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="not with the far away home I see in that eye !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , my Captain !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="my Captain !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="noble soul !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="grand old heart , after all !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="why should any one give chase to that hated fish !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Away with me !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="let us fly these deadly waters !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="let us home !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Wife and child , too , are Starbuck ' s -- wife and child of his brotherly , sisterly , play - fellow youth ; even as thine , sir , are the wife and child of thy loving , longing , paternal old age !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Away !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="let us away !-- this instant let me alter the course !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How cheerily , how hilariously , O my Captain , would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I think , sir , they have some such mild blue days , even as this , in Nantucket .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; They have , they have ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I have seen them -- some summer days in the morning ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="About this time -- yes , it is his noon nap now -- the boy vivaciously wakes ; sits up in bed ; and his mother tells him of me , of cannibal old me ; how I am abroad upon the deep , but will yet come back to dance him again .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot;' Tis my Mary , my Mary herself !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="She promised that my boy , every morning , should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father ' s sail !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="&quot; What is it , what nameless , inscrutable , unearthly thing is it ; what cozening , hidden lord and master , and cruel , remorseless emperor commands me ; that against all natural lovings and longings , I so keep pushing , and crowding , and jamming myself on all the time ; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper , natural heart , I durst not so much as dare ?" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="But blanched to a corpse ' s hue with despair , the Mate had stolen away ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side ; but started at two reflected , fixed eyes in the water there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 133" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Chase -- First Day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That night , in the mid - watch , when the old man -- as his wont at intervals -- stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went to his pivot - hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship ' s dog will , in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He declared that a whale must be near ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon that peculiar odor , sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale , was palpable to all the watch ; nor was any mariner surprised when , after inspecting the compass , and then the dog - vane , and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible , Ahab rapidly ordered the ship ' s course to be slightly altered , and the sail to be shortened ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak , by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it , the polished metallic - like marks of some swift tide - rip , at the mouth of a deep , rapid stream ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Man the mast - heads !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Call all hands !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck , Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle , so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What d ' ye see ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , flattening his face to the sky ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Nothing , nothing sir !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was the sound hailing down in reply ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; T ' gallant sails !-- stunsails !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="alow and aloft , and on both sides !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All sail being set , he now cast loose the life - line , reserved for swaying him to the main royal - mast head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main - top - sail and top - gallant - sail , he raised a gull - like cry in the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There she blows !-- there she blows !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A hump like a snow - hill !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is Moby Dick !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look - outs , the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab had now gained his final perch , some feet above the other look - outs , Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top - gallant - mast , so that the Indian ' s head was almost on a level with Ahab ' s heel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead , at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump , and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And did none of ye see it before ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , hailing the perched men all around him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I saw him almost that same instant , sir , that Captain Ahab did , and I cried out ,&quot; said Tashtego ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Not the same instant ; not the same -- no , the doubloon is mine , Fate reserved the doubloon for me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I only ; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There she blows !-- there she blows !-- there she blows !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There again !-- there again !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he cried , in long - drawn , lingering , methodic tones , attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale ' s visible jets ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He ' s going to sound !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In stunsails !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Down top - gallant - sails !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stand by three boats ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mr . Starbuck , remember , stay on board , and keep the ship ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Helm there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Luff , luff a point !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So ; steady , man , steady !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There go flukes !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No , no ; only black water !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="All ready the boats there ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stand by , stand by !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lower me , Mr . Starbuck ; lower , lower ,-- quick , quicker !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and he slid through the air to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; He is heading straight to leeward , sir ,&quot; cried Stubb , &quot; right away from us ; cannot have seen the ship yet .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Be dumb , man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stand by the braces !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hard down the helm !-- brace up !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shiver her !-- shiver her !-- So ; well that !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Boats , boats !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon all the boats but Starbuck ' s were dropped ; all the boat - sails set -- all the paddles plying ; with rippling swiftness , shooting to leeward ; and Ahab heading the onset ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A pale , death - glimmer lit up Fedallah ' s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like noiseless nautilus shells , their light prows sped through the sea ; but only slowly they neared the foe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As they neared him , the ocean grew still more smooth ; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves ; seemed a noon - meadow , so serenely it spread ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey , that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible , sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing , and continually set in a revolving ring of finest , fleecy , greenish foam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Before it , far out on the soft Turkish - rugged waters , went the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky forehead , a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade ; and behind , the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake ; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea , alternate with their fitful flight ; and like to some flag - staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy , the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale ' s back ; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft - toed fowls hovering , and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail feathers streaming like pennons ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A gentle joyousness -- a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness , invested the gliding whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns ; his lovely , leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid ; with smooth bewitching fleetness , rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete ; not Jove , not that great majesty Supreme !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On each soft side -- coincident with the parted swell , that but once leaving him , then flowed so wide away -- on each bright side , the whale shed off enticings ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity , had ventured to assail it ; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet calm , enticing calm , oh , whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thou glidest on , to all who for the first time eye thee , no matter how many in that same way thou may ' st have bejuggled and destroyed before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And thus , through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea , among waves whose hand - clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture , Moby Dick moved on , still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk , entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water ; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch , like Virginia ' s Natural Bridge , and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air , the grand god revealed himself , sounded , and went out of sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hoveringly halting , and dipping on the wing , the white sea - fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With oars apeak , and paddles down , the sheets of their sails adrift , the three boats now stilly floated , awaiting Moby Dick ' s reappearance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; An hour ,&quot; said Ahab , standing rooted in his boat ' s stern ; and he gazed beyond the whale ' s place , towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was only an instant ; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The breeze now freshened ; the sea began to swell ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The birds !-- the birds !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Tashtego ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In long Indian file , as when herons take wing , the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab ' s boat ; and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there , wheeling round and round , with joyous , expectant cries ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Their vision was keener than man ' s ; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths , he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel , with wonderful celerity uprising , and magnifying as it rose , till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the undiscoverable bottom ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was Moby Dick ' s open mouth and scrolled jaw ; his vast , shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open - doored marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then , calling upon Fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing Perth ' s harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by anticipation , was made to face the whale ' s head while yet under water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as if perceiving this stratagem , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it thrilled for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark , slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a row - lock ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The bluish pearl - white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab ' s head , and reached higher than that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the tiger - yellow crew were tumbling over each other ' s heads to gain the uttermost stern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac Ahab , furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated ; frenzied with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ; the frail gunwales bent in , collapsed , and snapped , as both jaws , like an enormous shears , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two floating wrecks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="These floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the stern - wreck clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At that preluding moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , Ahab , the first to perceive the whale ' s intent , by the crafty upraising of his head , a movement that loosed his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But only slipping further into the whale ' s mouth , and tilting over sideways as it slipped , the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell flat - faced upon the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey , Moby Dick now lay at a little distance , vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows ; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body ; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose -- some twenty or more feet out of the water -- the now rising swells , with all their confluent waves , dazzlingly broke against it ; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* So , in a gale , the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone , triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="* This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It receives its designation ( pitchpoling ) from its being likened to that preliminary up - and - down poise of the whale - lance , in the exercise called pitchpoling , previously described ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But soon resuming his horizontal attitude , Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him , as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus ' s elephants in the book of Maccabees ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale ' s insolent tail , and too much of a cripple to swim ,-- though he could still keep afloat , even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that ; helpless Ahab ' s head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="From the boat ' s fragmentary stern , Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other drifting end , could not succor him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale ' s aspect , and so planetarily swift the ever - contracting circles he made , that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways , Ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="With straining eyes , then , they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old man ' s head ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship ' s mast heads ; and squaring her yards , she had borne down upon the scene ; and was now so nigh , that Ahab in the water hailed her !--&quot; Sail on the &quot;-- but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick , and whelmed him for the time ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But struggling out of it again , and chancing to rise on a towering crest , he shouted ,--&quot; Sail on the whale !-- Drive him off !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Pequod ' s prows were pointed ; and breaking up the charmed circle , she effectually parted the white whale from his victim ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As he sullenly swam off , the boats flew to the rescue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dragged into Stubb ' s boat with blood - shot , blinded eyes , the white brine caking in his wrinkles ; the long tension of Ahab ' s bodily strength did crack , and helplessly he yielded to his body ' s doom : for a time , lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb ' s boat , like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Far inland , nameless wails came from him , as desolate sounds from out ravines ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In an instant ' s compass , great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang , the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men ' s whole lives ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so , such hearts , though summary in each one suffering ; still , if the gods decree it , in their life - time aggregate a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous intensities ; for even in their pointless centres , those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The harpoon ,&quot; said Ahab , half way rising , and draggingly leaning on one bended arm --&quot; is it safe ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , sir , for it was not darted ; this is it ,&quot; said Stubb , showing it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lay it before me ;-- any missing men ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; One , two , three , four , five ;-- there were five oars , sir , and here are five men .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; That ' s good .-- Help me , man ; I wish to stand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , so , I see him !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="going to leeward still ; what a leaping spout !-- Hands off from me !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The eternal sap runs up in Ahab ' s bones again !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Set the sail ; out oars ; the helm !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is often the case that when a boat is stove , its crew , being picked up by another boat , help to work that second boat ; and the chase is thus continued with what is called double - banked oars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was thus now ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale , for he seemed to have treble - banked his every fin ; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed , that if now , under these circumstances , pushed on , the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged , if not a hopeless one ; nor could any crew endure for so long a period , such an unintermitted , intense straining at the oar ; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship itself , then , as it sometimes happens , offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Accordingly , the boats now made for her , and were soon swayed up to their cranes -- the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her -- and then hoisting everything to her side , and stacking her canvas high up , and sideways outstretching it with stun - sails , like the double - jointed wings of an albatross ; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby - Dick ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At the well known , methodic intervals , the whale ' s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast - heads ; and when he would be reported as just gone down , Ahab would take the time , and then pacing the deck , binnacle - watch in hand , so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired , his voice was heard .--&quot; Whose is the doubloon now ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="D ' ye see him ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and if the reply was , No , sir !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In this way the day wore on ; Ahab , now aloft and motionless ; anon , unrestingly pacing the planks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As he was thus walking , uttering no sound , except to hail the men aloft , or to bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still greater breadth -- thus to and fro pacing , beneath his slouched hat , at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat , which had been dropped upon the quarter - deck , and lay there reversed ; broken bow to shattered stern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At last he paused before it ; and as in an already over - clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across , so over the old man ' s face there now stole some such added gloom as this ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb saw him pause ; and perhaps intending , not vainly , though , to evince his own unabated fortitude , and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain ' s mind , he advanced , and eyeing the wreck exclaimed --&quot; The thistle the ass refused ; it pricked his mouth too keenly , sir ; ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ha !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Man , man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="did I not know thee brave as fearless fire ( and as mechanical ) I could swear thou wert a poltroon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , sir ,&quot; said Starbuck drawing near , &quot;' tis a solemn sight ; an omen , and an ill one .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Omen ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="omen ?-- the dictionary !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="If the gods think to speak outright to man , they will honourably speak outright ; not shake their heads , and give an old wives ' darkling hint .-- Begone !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing ; Starbuck is Stubb reversed , and Stubb is Starbuck ; and ye two are all mankind ; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth , nor gods nor men his neighbors !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Cold , cold -- I shiver !-- How now ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aloft there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="D ' ye see him ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sing out for every spout , though he spout ten times a second !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The day was nearly done ; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon , it was almost dark , but the look - out men still remained unset ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Can ' t see the spout now , sir ;-- too dark &quot;-- cried a voice from the air ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; How heading when last seen ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; As before , sir ,-- straight to leeward .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Good !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he will travel slower now ' tis night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Down royals and top - gallant stun - sails , Mr . Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We must not run over him before morning ; he ' s making a passage now , and may heave - to a while ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Helm there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="keep her full before the wind !-- Aloft !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="come down !-- Mr ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stubb , send a fresh hand to the fore - mast head , and see it manned till morning .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main - mast --&quot; Men , this gold is mine , for I earned it ; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead ; and then , whosoever of ye first raises him , upon the day he shall be killed , this gold is that man ' s ; and if on that day I shall again raise him , then , ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Away now !-- the deck is thine , sir !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And so saying , he placed himself half way within the scuttle , and slouching his hat , stood there till dawn , except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 134" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Chase -- Second Day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At day - break , the three mast - heads were punctually manned afresh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; D ' ye see him ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; See nothing , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Turn up all hands and make sail !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he travels faster than I thought for ;-- the top - gallant sails !-- aye , they should have been kept on her all night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But no matter --' tis but resting for the rush .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here be it said , that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale , continued through day into night , and through night into day , is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For such is the wonderful skill , prescience of experience , and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders ; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they will , under certain given circumstances , pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of sight , as well as his probable rate of progression during that period ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general trending he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen headland , eventually to be visited : so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night obscures the fish , the creature ' s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot ' s coast is to him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So that to this hunter ' s wondrous skill , the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water , a wake , is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as doctors that of a baby ' s pulse ; and lightly say of it , the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; even so , almost , there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman ' s allies ; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety - three leagues and a quarter from his port ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Inferable from these statements , are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship tore on ; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon - ball , missent , becomes a plough - share and turns up the level field ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; By salt and hemp !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb , &quot; but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one ' s legs and tingles at the heart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This ship and I are two brave fellows !-- Ha , ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some one take me up , and launch me , spine - wise , on the sea ,-- for by live - oaks !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="my spine ' s a keel ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha , ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="we go the gait that leaves no dust behind !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There she blows -- she blows !-- she blows !-- right ahead !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was now the mast - head cry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb , &quot; I knew it -- ye can ' t escape -- blow on and split your spout , O whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the mad fiend himself is after ye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="blow your trump -- blister your lungs !-- Ahab will dam off your blood , as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up , like old wine worked anew ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides routed , as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the stirring perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night ' s suspense ; the fixed , unfearing , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were bowled along ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They were one man , not thirty ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For as the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things -- oak , and maple , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp -- yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull , which shot on its way , both balanced and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the individualities of the crew , this man ' s valor , that man ' s fear ; guilt and guiltiness , all varieties were welded into oneness , and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The rigging lived ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The mast - heads , like the tops of tall palms , were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Clinging to a spar with one hand , some reached forth the other with impatient wavings ; others , shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for their fate ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ah !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Why sing ye not out for him , if ye see him ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , when , after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry , no more had been heard ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sway me up , men ; ye have been deceived ; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way , and then disappears .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale - spout , as the event itself soon proved ; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck , when he struck the key - note to an orchestra , that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard , as -- much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet , less than a mile ahead -- Moby Dick bodily burst into view !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths , the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air , and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam , shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In those moments , the torn , enraged waves he shakes off , seem his mane ; in some cases , this breaching is his act of defiance ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; There she breaches !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="there she breaches !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="was the cry , as in his immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon - like to Heaven ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea , and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky , the spray that he raised , for the moment , intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier ; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity , to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , breach your last to the sun , Moby Dick !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , &quot; thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand !-- Down !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="down all of ye , but one man at the fore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The boats !-- stand by !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Unmindful of the tedious rope - ladders of the shrouds , the men , like shooting stars , slid to the deck , by the isolated backstays and halyards ; while Ahab , less dartingly , but still rapidly was dropped from his perch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lower away ,&quot; he cried , so soon as he had reached his boat -- a spare one , rigged the afternoon previous ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Mr . Starbuck , the ship is thine -- keep away from the boats , but keep near them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lower , all !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As if to strike a quick terror into them , by this time being the first assailant himself , Moby Dick had turned , and was now coming for the three crews ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab ' s boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them he would take the whale head - and - head ,-- that is , pull straight up to his forehead ,-- a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale ' s sidelong vision ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship ' s three masts to his eye ; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But skilfully manoeuvred , incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field ; the boats for a while eluded him ; though , at times , but by a plank ' s breadth ; while all the time , Ahab ' s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at last in his untraceable evolutions , the White Whale so crossed and recrossed , and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him , that they foreshortened , and , of themselves , warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to rally for a more tremendous charge ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seizing that opportunity , Ahab first paid out more line : and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again -- hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls -- when lo !-- a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Caught and twisted -- corkscrewed in the mazes of the line , loose harpoons and lances , with all their bristling barbs and points , came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab ' s boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Only one thing could be done ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Seizing the boat - knife , he critically reached within -- through -- and then , without -- the rays of steel ; dragged in the line beyond , passed it , inboard , to the bowsman , and then , twice sundering the rope near the chocks -- dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea ; and was all fast again ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="That instant , the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines ; by so doing , irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf - beaten beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling maelstrom , in which , for a space , the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round , like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While the two crews were yet circling in the waters , reaching out after the revolving line - tubs , oars , and other floating furniture , while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial , twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up ; and while the old man ' s line -- now parting -- admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could ;-- in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils ,-- Ahab ' s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires ,-- as , arrow - like , shooting perpendicularly from the sea , the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ; till it fell again -- gunwale downwards -- and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it , like seals from a sea - side cave ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The first uprising momentum of the whale -- modifying its direction as he struck the surface -- involuntarily launched him along it , to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side ; and whenever a stray oar , bit of plank , the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and came sideways smiting the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But soon , as if satisfied that his work for that time was done , he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean , and trailing after him the intertangled lines , continued his leeward way at a traveller ' s methodic pace ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As before , the attentive ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some sprained shoulders , wrists , and ankles ; livid contusions ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; inextricable intricacies of rope ; shattered oars and planks ; all these were there ; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As with Fedallah the day before , so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat ' s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day ' s mishap ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when he was helped to the deck , all eyes were fastened upon him ; as instead of standing by himself he still half - hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck , who had thus far been the foremost to assist him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="His ivory leg had been snapped off , leaving but one short sharp splinter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye , Starbuck , ' tis sweet to lean sometimes , be the leaner who he will ; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The ferrule has not stood , sir ,&quot; said the carpenter , now coming up ; &quot; I put good work into that leg .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But no bones broken , sir , I hope ,&quot; said Stubb with true concern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and all splintered to pieces , Stubb !-- d ' ye see it .-- But even with a broken bone , old Ahab is untouched ; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me , than this dead one that ' s lost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder roof ?-- Aloft there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="which way ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Dead to leeward , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Up helm , then ; pile on the sail again , ship keepers !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="down the rest of the spare boats and rig them -- Mr . Starbuck away , and muster the boat ' s crews .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , oh , oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how this splinter gores me now !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Accursed fate !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sir ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; My body , man , not thee ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Give me something for a cane -- there , that shivered lance will do ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Muster the men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Surely I have not seen him yet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By heaven it cannot be !-- missing ?-- quick !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="call them all .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The old man ' s hinted thought was true ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Upon mustering the company , the Parsee was not there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The Parsee !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Stubb --&quot; he must have been caught in --&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The black vomit wrench thee !-- run all of ye above , alow , cabin , forecastle -- find him -- not gone -- not gone !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , sir ,&quot; said Stubb --&quot; caught among the tangles of your line -- I thought I saw him dragging under .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; MY line !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="MY line ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Gone ?-- gone ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What means that little word ?-- What death - knell rings in it , that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The harpoon , too !-- toss over the litter there ,-- d ' ye see it ?-- the forged iron , men , the white whale ' s -- no , no , no ,-- blistered fool !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="this hand did dart it !--' tis in the fish !-- Aloft there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Keep him nailed -- Quick !-- all hands to the rigging of the boats -- collect the oars -- harpooneers !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the irons , the irons !-- hoist the royals higher -- a pull on all the sheets !-- helm there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="steady , steady for your life !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but I ' ll slay him yet !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Great God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="but for one single instant show thyself ,&quot; cried Starbuck ; &quot; never , never wilt thou capture him , old man -- In Jesus ' name no more of this , that ' s worse than devil ' s madness ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Two days chased ; twice stove to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil shadow gone -- all good angels mobbing thee with warnings :-- what more wouldst thou have ?-- Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , oh ,-- Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Starbuck , of late I ' ve felt strangely moved to thee ; ever since that hour we both saw -- thou know ' st what , in one another ' s eyes ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But in this matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand -- a lipless , unfeatured blank ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab is for ever Ahab , man ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="This whole act ' s immutably decreed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Look thou , underling !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="that thou obeyest mine .-- Stand round me , men ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ye see an old man cut down to the stump ; leaning on a shivered lance ; propped up on a lonely foot ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' Tis Ahab -- his body ' s part ; but Ahab ' s soul ' s a centipede , that moves upon a hundred legs ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I feel strained , half stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale ; and I may look so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But ere I break , yell hear me crack ; and till ye hear THAT , know that Ahab ' s hawser tows his purpose yet ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Believe ye , men , in the things called omens ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then laugh aloud , and cry encore !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For ere they drown , drowning things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , to sink for evermore ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So with Moby Dick -- two days he ' s floated -- tomorrow will be the third ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , men , he ' ll rise once more ,-- but only to spout his last !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="D ' ye feel brave men , brave ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; As fearless fire ,&quot; cried Stubb ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; And as mechanical ,&quot; muttered Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Then as the men went forward , he muttered on : &quot; The things called omens !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there , concerning my broken boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="how valiantly I seek to drive out of others ' hearts what ' s clinched so fast in mine !-- The Parsee -- the Parsee !-- gone , gone ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and he was to go before :-- but still was to be seen again ere I could perish -- How ' s that ?-- There ' s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges :-- like a hawk ' s beak it pecks my brain ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' LL , I ' LL solve it , though !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When dusk descended , the whale was still in sight to leeward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So once more the sail was shortened , and everything passed nearly as on the previous night ; only , the sound of hammers , and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight , as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , of the broken keel of Ahab ' s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg ; while still as on the night before , slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle ; his hid , heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial ; sat due eastward for the earliest sun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="CHAPTER 135" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The Chase .-- Third Day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh , and once more the solitary night - man at the fore - mast - head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look - outs , who dotted every mast and almost every spar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; D ' ye see him ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab ; but the whale was not yet in sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; In his infallible wake , though ; but follow that wake , that ' s all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Helm there ; steady , as thou goest , and hast been going ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What a lovely day again !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="were it a new - made world , and made for a summer - house to the angels , and this morning the first of its throwing open to them , a fairer day could not dawn upon that world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Here ' s food for thought , had Ahab time to think ; but Ahab never thinks ; he only feels , feels , feels ; THAT ' S tingling enough for mortal man !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="to think ' s audacity ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="God only has that right and privilege ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Thinking is , or ought to be , a coolness and a calmness ; and our poor hearts throb , and our poor brains beat too much for that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yet , I ' ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm -- frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must breed it ; but no , it ' s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells , and wards of hospitals , and ventilated them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Were I the wind , I ' d blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' d crawl somewhere to a cave , and slink there ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And yet , ' tis a noble and heroic thing , the wind !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="who ever conquered it ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Run tilting at it , and you but run through it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="a coward wind that strikes stark naked men , but will not stand to receive a single blow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Even Ahab is a braver thing -- a nobler thing than THAT ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="These warm Trade Winds , at least , that in the clear heavens blow straight on , in strong and steadfast , vigorous mildness ; and veer not from their mark , however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack , and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about , uncertain where to go at last ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on ; these Trades , or something like them -- something so unchangeable , and full as strong , blow my keeled soul along !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Aye , aye , it must be so ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I ' ve oversailed him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="How , got the start ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , he ' s chasing ME now ; not I , HIM -- that ' s bad ; I might have known it , too ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Fool !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the lines -- the harpoons he ' s towing ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , aye , I have run him by last night ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="About !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="about !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Come down , all of ye , but the regular look outs !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Man the braces !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Steering as she had done , the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod ' s quarter , so that now being pointed in the reverse direction , the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw ,&quot; murmured Starbuck to himself , as he coiled the new - hauled main - brace upon the rail ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; God keep us , but already my bones feel damp within me , and from the inside wet my flesh ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stand by to sway me up !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab , advancing to the hempen basket ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; We should meet him soon .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , aye , sir ,&quot; and straightway Starbuck did Ahab ' s bidding , and once more Ahab swung on high ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A whole hour now passed ; gold - beaten out to ages ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But at last , some three points off the weather bow , Ahab descried the spout again , and instantly from the three mast - heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Forehead to forehead I meet thee , this third time , Moby Dick !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="On deck there !-- brace sharper up ; crowd her into the wind ' s eye ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He ' s too far off to lower yet , Mr . Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The sails shake !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stand over that helmsman with a top - maul !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , so ; he travels fast , and I must down ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea ; there ' s time for that ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="An old , old sight , and yet somehow so young ; aye , and not changed a wink since I first saw it , a boy , from the sand - hills of Nantucket !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The same !-- the same !-- the same to Noah as to me ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s a soft shower to leeward ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Such lovely leewardings !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="They must lead somewhere -- to something else than common land , more palmy than the palms ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Leeward !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the white whale goes that way ; look to windward , then ; the better if the bitterer quarter ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But good bye , good bye , old mast - head !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s this ?-- green ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="aye , tiny mosses in these warped cracks ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="No such green weather stains on Ahab ' s head !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="There ' s the difference now between man ' s old age and matter ' s ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But aye , old mast , we both grow old together ; sound in our hulls , though , are we not , my ship ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , minus a leg , that ' s all ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I can ' t compare with it ; and I ' ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ' s that he said ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he should still go before me , my pilot ; and yet to be seen again ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But where ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea , supposing I descend those endless stairs ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and all night I ' ve been sailing from him , wherever he did sink to ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , aye , like many more thou told ' st direful truth as touching thyself , O Parsee ; but , Ahab , there thy shot fell short ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Good - bye , mast - head -- keep a good eye upon the whale , the while I ' m gone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="We ' ll talk to - morrow , nay , to - night , when the white whale lies down there , tied by head and tail .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He gave the word ; and still gazing round him , was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his shallop ' s stern , Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent , he waved to the mate ,-- who held one of the tackle - ropes on deck -- and bade him pause ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Starbuck !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Sir ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; For the third time my soul ' s ship starts upon this voyage , Starbuck .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Aye , sir , thou wilt have it so .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Some ships sail from their ports , and ever afterwards are missing , Starbuck !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Truth , sir : saddest truth .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Some men die at ebb tide ; some at low water ; some at the full of the flood ;-- and I feel now like a billow that ' s all one crested comb , Starbuck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I am old ;-- shake hands with me , man .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; Starbuck ' s tears the glue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh , my captain , my captain !-- noble heart -- go not -- go not !-- see , it ' s a brave man that weeps ; how great the agony of the persuasion then !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Lower away !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- cried Ahab , tossing the mate ' s arm from him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stand by the crew !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The sharks !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the sharks !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried a voice from the low cabin - window there ; &quot; O master , my master , come back !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But Ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was high - lifted then ; and the boat leaped on ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Yet the voice spake true ; for scarce had he pushed from the ship , when numbers of sharks , seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull , maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars , every time they dipped in the water ; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale - boats in those swarming seas ; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried ; and whether it was that Ahab ' s crew were all such tiger - yellow barbarians , and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks -- a matter sometimes well known to affect them ,-- however it was , they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Heart of wrought steel !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="murmured Starbuck gazing over the side , and following with his eyes the receding boat --&quot; canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight ?-- lowering thy keel among ravening sharks , and followed by them , open - mouthed to the chase ; and this the critical third day ?-- For when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit ; be sure the first is the morning , the second the noon , and the third the evening and the end of that thing -- be that end what it may ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="my God !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="what is this that shoots through me , and leaves me so deadly calm , yet expectant ,-- fixed at the top of a shudder !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Future things swim before me , as in empty outlines and skeletons ; all the past is somehow grown dim ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Mary , girl !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thou fadest in pale glories behind me ; boy !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Strangest problems of life seem clearing ; but clouds sweep between -- Is my journey ' s end coming ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My legs feel faint ; like his who has footed it all day ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Feel thy heart ,-- beats it yet ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Stir thyself , Starbuck !-- stave it off -- move , move !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="speak aloud !-- Mast - head there !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See ye my boy ' s hand on the hill ?-- Crazed ;-- aloft there !-- keep thy keenest eye upon the boats :-- mark well the whale !-- Ho !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="again !-- drive off that hawk !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="see !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he pecks -- he tears the vane &quot;-- pointing to the red flag flying at the main - truck --&quot; Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="he soars away with it !-- Where ' s the old man now ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="see ' st thou that sight , oh Ahab !-- shudder , shudder !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The boats had not gone very far , when by a signal from the mast - heads -- a downward pointed arm , Ahab knew that the whale had sounded ; but intending to be near him at the next rising , he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel ; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence , as the head - beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Drive , drive in your nails , oh ye waves !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="to their uttermost heads drive them in !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ye but strike a thing without a lid ; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine :-- and hemp only can kill me !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ha !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ha !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles ; then quickly upheaved , as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice , swiftly rising to the surface ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A low rumbling sound was heard ; a subterraneous hum ; and then all held their breaths ; as bedraggled with trailing ropes , and harpoons , and lances , a vast form shot lengthwise , but obliquely from the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist , it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air ; and then fell swamping back into the deep ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Crushed thirty feet upwards , the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains , then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes , leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Give way !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried Ahab to the oarsmen , and the boats darted forward to the attack ; but maddened by yesterday ' s fresh irons that corroded in him , Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead , beneath the transparent skin , looked knitted together ; as head on , he came churning his tail among the boats ; and once more flailed them apart ; spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates ' boats , and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows , but leaving Ahab ' s almost without a scar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks ; and as the whale swimming out from them , turned , and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again ; at that moment a quick cry went up ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Lashed round and round to the fish ' s back ; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him , the half torn body of the Parsee was seen ; his sable raiment frayed to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The harpoon dropped from his hand ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Befooled , befooled !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="-- drawing in a long lean breath --&quot; Aye , Parsee !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I see thee again .-- Aye , and thou goest before ; and this , THIS then is the hearse that thou didst promise ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Where is the second hearse ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Away , mates , to the ship !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="those boats are useless now ; repair them if ye can in time , and return to me ; if not , Ahab is enough to die -- Down , men !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in , that thing I harpoon ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ye are not other men , but my arms and my legs ; and so obey me .-- Where ' s the whale ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="gone down again ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he looked too nigh the boat ; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore , and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage , Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward ; and had almost passed the ship ,-- which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him , though for the present her headway had been stopped ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab ,&quot; cried Starbuck , &quot; not too late is it , even now , the third day , to desist ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="See !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Moby Dick seeks thee not ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It is thou , thou , that madly seekest him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Setting sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward , by both oars and canvas ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel , so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck ' s face as he leaned over the rail , he hailed him to turn the vessel about , and follow him , not too swiftly , at a judicious interval ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Glancing upwards , he saw Tashtego , Queequeg , and Daggoo , eagerly mounting to the three mast - heads ; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side , and were busily at work in repairing them ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="One after the other , through the port - holes , as he sped , he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask , busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As he saw all this ; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats ; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But he rallied ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main - mast - head , he shouted to Tashtego , who had just gained that perch , to descend again for another flag , and a hammer and nails , and so nail it to the mast ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Whether fagged by the three days ' running chase , and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore ; or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him : whichever was true , the White Whale ' s way now began to abate , as it seemed , from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more ; though indeed the whale ' s last start had not been so long a one as before ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him ; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat ; and so continually bit at the plying oars , that the blades became jagged and crunched , and left small splinters in the sea , at almost every dip ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Heed them not !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Pull on !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="' tis the better rest , the shark ' s jaw than the yielding water .&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; But at every bite , sir , the thin blades grow smaller and smaller !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; They will last long enough !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="pull on !-- But who can tell &quot;-- he muttered --&quot; whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab ?-- But pull on !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Aye , all alive , now -- we near him ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The helm !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="take the helm !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="let me pass ,&quot;-- and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="At length as the craft was cast to one side , and ran ranging along with the White Whale ' s flank , he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance -- as the whale sometimes will -- and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist , which , thrown off from the whale ' s spout , curled round his great , Monadnock hump ; he was even thus close to him ; when , with body arched back , and both arms lengthwise high - lifted to the poise , he darted his fierce iron , and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As both steel and curse sank to the socket , as if sucked into a morass , Moby Dick sideways writhed ; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow , and , without staving a hole in it , so suddenly canted the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung , Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="As it was , three of the oarsmen -- who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart , and were therefore unprepared for its effects -- these were flung out ; but so fell , that , in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again , and rising to its level on a combing wave , hurled themselves bodily inboard again ; the third man helplessly dropping astern , but still afloat and swimming ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of ungraduated , instantaneous swiftness , the White Whale darted through the weltering sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line , and hold it so ; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats , and tow the boat up to the mark ; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug , it snapped in the empty air !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; What breaks in me ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some sinew cracks !--' tis whole again ; oars !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="oars !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Burst in upon him !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea - crashing boat , the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay ; but in that evolution , catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship ; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions ; bethinking it -- it may be -- a larger and nobler foe ; of a sudden , he bore down upon its advancing prow , smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab staggered ; his hand smote his forehead ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I grow blind ; hands !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is ' t night ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The ship !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="cried the cringing oarsmen ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Oars !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="oars !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Slope downwards to thy depths , O sea , that ere it be for ever too late , Ahab may slide this last , last time upon his mark !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I see : the ship !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the ship !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Dash on , my men !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Will ye not save my ship ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge - hammering seas , the before whale - smitten bow - ends of two planks burst through , and in an instant almost , the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves ; its half - wading , splashing crew , trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Meantime , for that one beholding instant , Tashtego ' s mast - head hammer remained suspended in his hand ; and the red flag , half - wrapping him as with a plaid , then streamed itself straight out from him , as his own forward - flowing heart ; while Starbuck and Stubb , standing upon the bowsprit beneath , caught sight of the down - coming monster just as soon as he ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The whale , the whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Up helm , up helm !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , all ye sweet powers of air , now hug me close !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Let not Starbuck die , if die he must , in a woman ' s fainting fit ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Up helm , I say -- ye fools , the jaw !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="the jaw !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Is this the end of all my bursting prayers ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="all my life - long fidelities ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , Ahab , Ahab , lo , thy work ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Steady !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="helmsman , steady ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Nay , nay !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Up helm again !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="He turns to meet us !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , his unappeasable brow drives on towards one , whose duty tells him he cannot depart ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="My God , stand by me now !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help Stubb ; for Stubb , too , sticks here ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Who ever helped Stubb , or kept Stubb awake , but Stubb ' s own unwinking eye ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft ; would it were stuffed with brushwood !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Look ye , sun , moon , and stars !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For all that , I would yet ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="oh , oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="thou grinning whale , but there ' ll be plenty of gulping soon !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why fly ye not , O Ahab !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let Stubb die in his drawers !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A most mouldy and over salted death , though ;-- cherries !" sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="Oh , Flask , for one red cherry ere we die !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; Cherries ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="I only wish that we were where they grow ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="From the ship ' s bows , nearly all the seamen now hung inactive ; hammers , bits of plank , lances , and harpoons , mechanically retained in their hands , just as they had darted from their various employments ; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale , which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head , sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Retribution , swift vengeance , eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal man could do , the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship ' s starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Some fell flat upon their faces ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Like dislodged trucks , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull - like necks ." sensical="true" />

	<utterance text="cried Ahab from the boat ; &quot; its wood could only be American !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Diving beneath the settling ship , the whale ran quivering along its keel ; but turning under water , swiftly shot to the surface again , far off the other bow , but within a few yards of Ahab ' s boat , where , for a time , he lay quiescent ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; I turn my body from the sun ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="What ho , Tashtego !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="let me hear thy hammer ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="ye three unsurrendered spires of mine ; thou uncracked keel ; and only god - bullied hull ; thou firm deck , and haughty helm , and Pole - pointed prow ,-- death - glorious ship !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="must ye then perish , and without me ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , lonely death on lonely life !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Oh , now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ho , ho !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="from all your furthest bounds , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole foregone life , and top this one piled comber of my death !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Towards thee I roll , thou all - destroying but unconquering whale ; to the last I grapple with thee ; from hell ' s heart I stab at thee ; for hate ' s sake I spit my last breath at thee ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="and since neither can be mine , let me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , thou damned whale !" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="THUS , I give up the spear !&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The harpoon was darted ; the stricken whale flew forward ; with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves ;-- ran foul ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Ahab stooped to clear it ; he did clear it ; but the flying turn caught him round the neck , and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim , he was shot out of the boat , ere the crew knew he was gone ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Next instant , the heavy eye - splice in the rope ' s final end flew out of the stark - empty tub , knocked down an oarsman , and smiting the sea , disappeared in its depths ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="For an instant , the tranced boat ' s crew stood still ; then turned ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; The ship ?" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Great God , where is the ship ?&quot;" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Soon they through dim , bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom , as in the gaseous Fata Morgana ; only the uppermost masts out of water ; while fixed by infatuation , or fidelity , or fate , to their once lofty perches , the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="And now , concentric circles seized the lone boat itself , and all its crew , and each floating oar , and every lance - pole , and spinning , animate and inanimate , all round and round in one vortex , carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible , together with long streaming yards of the flag , which calmly undulated , with ironical coincidings , over the destroying billows they almost touched ;-- at that instant , a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air , in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="A sky - hawk that tauntingly had followed the main - truck downwards from its natural home among the stars , pecking at the flag , and incommoding Tashtego there ; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill , the submerged savage beneath , in his death - gasp , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with archangelic shrieks , and his imperial beak thrust upwards , and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab , went down with his ship , which , like Satan , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and helmeted herself with it ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf ; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides ; then all collapsed , and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Epilogue" sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="&quot; AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE &quot; Job ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The drama ' s done ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Why then here does any one step forth ?-- Because one did survive the wreck ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="It so chanced , that after the Parsee ' s disappearance , I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab ' s bowsman , when that bowsman assumed the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="So , floating on the margin of the ensuing scene , and in full sight of it , when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me , I was then , but slowly , drawn towards the closing vortex ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="When I reached it , it had subsided to a creamy pool ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Round and round , then , and ever contracting towards the button - like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another Ixion I did revolve ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Till , gaining that vital centre , the black bubble upward burst ; and now , liberated by reason of its cunning spring , and , owing to its great buoyancy , rising with great force , the coffin life - buoy shot lengthwise from the sea , fell over , and floated by my side ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="Buoyed up by that coffin , for almost one whole day and night , I floated on a soft and dirgelike main ." sensical="true" />
	<utterance text="The unharming sharks , they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths ; the savage sea - hawks sailed with sheathed beaks ." sensical="true" />
