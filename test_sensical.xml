for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope - maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale - line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope ' s durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale - lines ; for , though not so durable as hemp , it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic ; and I will add ( since there is an aesthetics in all things ), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat , than hemp ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of Indian ; but Manilla is as a golden - haired Circassian to behold ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The whale - line is only two - thirds of an inch in thickness ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="At first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="In length , the common sperm whale - line measures something over two hundred fathoms ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm - pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese - shaped mass of densely bedded &quot; sheaves ,&quot; or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the &quot; heart ,&quot; or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody ' s arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="There is some advantage in this ; because these twin - tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the American tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half - inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale - boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line - tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding - cake to present to the whales ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye - splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="First : In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="In these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Second : This arrangement is indispensable for common safety ' s sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town - crier would ever find her again ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man ' s oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it from slipping out ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms ( called box - line ) being coiled upon the box in the bows , it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the short - warp -- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the short - warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Thus the whale - line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as Indian jugglers , with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Yet habit -- strange thing !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="what cannot habit accomplish ?-- Gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half - inch white cedar of the whale - boat , when thus hung in hangman ' s nooses ; and , like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters -- some few of which are casually chronicled -- of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="For , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam - engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="It is worse ; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self - adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a Mazeppa of , and run away with where the all - seeing sun himself could never pierce you out ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Again : as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the explosion ; so the graceful repose of the line , as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play -- this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But why say more ?" sensical="true" /><utterance text="All men live enveloped in whale - lines ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="All are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , ever - present perils of life ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale - boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="CHAPTER 61" sensical="true" /><utterance text="Stubb Kills a Whale ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents , to Queequeg it was quite a different object ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; When you see him ' quid ,&quot; said the savage , honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat , &quot; then you quick see him ' parm whale .&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="The next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the Pequod ' s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying - fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the Rio de la Plata , or the in - shore ground off Peru ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="It was my turn to stand at the foremast - head ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="No resolution could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me , I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen - mast - heads were already drowsy ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The waves , too , nodded their indolent crests ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east nodded to west , and the sun over all ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious agency preserved me ; with a shock I came back to life ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And lo !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an Ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun ' s rays like a mirror ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="As if struck by some enchanter ' s wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; Clear away the boats !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="Luff !&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="cried Ahab ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , majestically turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in whispers ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; There go flukes !&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb ' s producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker ' s boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , Stubb counted upon the honour of the capture ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="It was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Paddles were dropped , and oars came loudly into play ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And still puffing at his pipe , Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Yes , a mighty change had come over the fish ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="All alive to his jeopardy , he was going &quot;

so also , just before reaching that point , it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb ' s hands , from which the hand - cloths , or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="It was like holding an enemy ' s sharp two - edged sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; Wet the line !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="wet the line !&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="cried Stubb to the tub oarsman ( him seated by the tub ) who , snatching off his hat , dashed sea - water into it ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="* More turns were taken , so that the line began holding its place ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Stubb and Tashtego here changed places -- stem for stern -- a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="* Partly to show the indispensableness of this act , it may here be stated , that , in the old Dutch fishery , a mop was used to dash the running line with water ; in many other ships , a wooden piggin , or bailer , is set apart for that purpose ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Your hat , however , is the most convenient ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat , and from its now being more tight than a harpstring , you would have thought the craft had two keels -- one cleaving the water , the other the air -- as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="A continual cascade played at the bows ; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Thus they rushed ; each man with might and main clinging to his seat , to prevent being tossed to the foam ; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double , in order to bring down his centre of gravity ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way , till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot;

at the word of command , the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale ' s horrible wallow , and then ranging up for another fling ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood , which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea , sent back its reflection into every face , so that they all glowed to each other like red men ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale , and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance ( by the line attached to it ), Stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot;

for , starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his &quot; flurry ,&quot; the monster horribly wallowed in his blood , overwrapped himself in impenetrable , mad , boiling spray , so that the imperilled craft , instantly dropping astern , had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And now abating in his flurry , the whale once more rolled out into view ; surging from side to side ; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout - hole , with sharp , cracking , agonized respirations ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="At last , gush after gush of clotted red gore , as if it had been the purple lees of red wine , shot into the frighted air ; and falling back again , ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="His heart had burst !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; He ' s dead , Mr .

for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But however prolonged and exhausting the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one ' s compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started -- what that is none know but those who have tried it ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="For one , I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="In this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry --&quot; Stand up , and give it to him !&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="He now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood - vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="Again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="It is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Now , I care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase ; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart , the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness , and not from out of toil ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="CHAPTER 63" sensical="true" /><utterance text="The Crotch ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Out of the trunk , the branches grow ;

now it was that there lurked a something in the old man ' s eyes , which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="As the unsetting polar star , which through the livelong , arctic , six months ' night sustains its piercing , steady , central gaze ;

when he thought no glance but one was on him ; then you would have seen that even as Ahab ' s eyes so awed the crew ' s , the inscrutable Parsee ' s glance awed his ; or somehow , at least , in some wild way , at times affected it ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Such an added , gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now ; such ceaseless shudderings shook him ; that the men looked dubious at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being ' s body ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And that shadow was always hovering there ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="For not by night , even , had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber , or go below ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="He would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ;

either standing in his pivot - hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits ,-- the main - mast and the mizen ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin - scuttle ,-- his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat , they could never tell unerringly whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently scanning them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the unheeded night - damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone - carved coat and hat ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The clothes that the night had wet , the next day ' s sunshine dried upon him ;

openly , and to the awe - struck crew , they seemed pole - like asunder ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="If by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="At times , for longest hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the starlight ; Ahab in his scuttle , the Parsee by the mainmast ; but still fixedly gazing upon each other ; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow , in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And yet , somehow , did Ahab -- in his own proper self , as daily , hourly , and every instant , commandingly revealed to his subordinates ,-- Ahab seemed an independent lord ; the Parsee but his slave ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Still again both seemed yoked together , and an unseen tyrant driving them ; the lean shade siding the solid rib ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="For be this Parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid Ahab ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft ,--&quot; Man the mast - heads !&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="-- and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman ' s bell , was heard --&quot; What d ' ye see ?-- sharp !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="sharp !&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="But when three or four days had slided by , after meeting the children - seeking Rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew ' s fidelity ; at least , of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But if these suspicions were really his , he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them , however his actions might seem to hint them ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; I will have the first sight of the whale myself ,&quot;-- he said ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; Aye !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="Ahab must have the doubloon !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single sheaved block , to secure to the main - mast head , he received the two ends of the downward - reeved rope ; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="This done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo , Queequeg , Tashtego ; but shunning Fedallah ; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate , said ,--&quot; Take the rope , sir -- I give it into thy hands , Starbuck .&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="Then arranging his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles ,-- ahead , astern , this side , and that ,-- within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no foothold , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and sustained there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Because in such a wilderness of running rigging , whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the deck - ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings , it would be but a natural fatality , if , unprovided with a constant watchman , the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="So Ahab ' s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that Starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision -- one of those too , whose faithfulness on the look - out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ;-- it was strange , that this was the very man he should select for his watchman ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person ' s hands ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Now , the first time Ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten minutes ; one of those red - billed savage sea - hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast - heads of whalemen in these latitudes ; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then spiralized downwards , and went eddying again round his head ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; Your hat , your hat , sir !&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman , who being posted at the mizen - mast - head , stood directly behind Ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But already the sable wing was before the old man ' s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin ' s head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon Tanaquil , his wife , declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Ahab ' s hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="CHAPTER 131" sensical="true" /><utterance text="The Pequod Meets The Delight ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The intense Pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the life - buoy - coffin still lightly swung ; and another ship , most miserably misnamed the Delight , was descried ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="As she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called shears , which , in some whaling - ships , cross the quarter - deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; serving to carry the spare , unrigged , or disabled boats ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Upon the stranger ' s shears were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale - boat ;

Not forged !&quot;" sensical="true" /><utterance text="and snatching Perth ' s levelled iron from the crotch , Ahab held it out , exclaiming --&quot; Look ye , Nantucketer ; here in this hand I hold his death !" sensical="true" /><utterance text="Tempered in blood , and tempered by lightning are these barbs ;

frenzied with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="As now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ;

by so doing , irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf - beaten beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling maelstrom , in which , for a space , the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round , like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="While the two crews were yet circling in the waters , reaching out after the revolving line - tubs , oars , and other floating furniture , while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial , twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up ; and while the old man ' s line -- now parting -- admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could ;-- in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils ,-- Ahab ' s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires ,-- as , arrow - like , shooting perpendicularly from the sea , the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ;

only the uppermost masts out of water ; while fixed by infatuation , or fidelity , or fate , to their once lofty perches , the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="And now , concentric circles seized the lone boat itself , and all its crew , and each floating oar , and every lance - pole , and spinning , animate and inanimate , all round and round in one vortex , carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible , together with long streaming yards of the flag , which calmly undulated , with ironical coincidings , over the destroying billows they almost touched ;-- at that instant , a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air , in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="A sky - hawk that tauntingly had followed the main - truck downwards from its natural home among the stars , pecking at the flag , and incommoding Tashtego there ; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill , the submerged savage beneath , in his death - gasp , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with archangelic shrieks , and his imperial beak thrust upwards , and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab , went down with his ship , which , like Satan , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and helmeted herself with it ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf ; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides ; then all collapsed , and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Epilogue" sensical="true" /><utterance text="&quot; AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE &quot; Job ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The drama ' s done ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Why then here does any one step forth ?-- Because one did survive the wreck ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="It so chanced , that after the Parsee ' s disappearance , I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab ' s bowsman , when that bowsman assumed the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="So , floating on the margin of the ensuing scene , and in full sight of it , when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me , I was then , but slowly , drawn towards the closing vortex ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="When I reached it , it had subsided to a creamy pool ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Round and round , then , and ever contracting towards the button - like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another Ixion I did revolve ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Till , gaining that vital centre , the black bubble upward burst ; and now , liberated by reason of its cunning spring , and , owing to its great buoyancy , rising with great force , the coffin life - buoy shot lengthwise from the sea , fell over , and floated by my side ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="Buoyed up by that coffin , for almost one whole day and night , I floated on a soft and dirgelike main ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="The unharming sharks , they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths ; the savage sea - hawks sailed with sheathed beaks ." sensical="true" /><utterance text="On the second day , a sail drew near , nearer , and picked me up at last ." sensical="true" /></corpus>
