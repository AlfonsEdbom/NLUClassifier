  <utterance text="Lovely delicate , fragrant Rhone wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Polished leather and strawberries ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Perhaps a bit dilute , but good for drinking now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Liquorice , cherry fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Simple and coarse at the finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Thin and completely uninspiring ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Rough ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="No Stars Big , fat , textured Chardonnay - nuts and butterscotch ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A slightly odd metallic / cardboard finish , but probably *** A blind tasting , other than the fizz , which included five vintages of Cote Rotie Brune et Blonde from Guigal ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Surprisingly young feeling and drinking well , but without any great complexity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good *** Charming , violet - fragranced nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Classic Guigal Cote Rotie ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Good grip and a touch of rusticity on the length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="VA showing through ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="On the downhill slope ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Just **** Just about holding together - drying out a touch at the finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not as good as I thought this would be ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good *** In your face wine - rather obvious and simple ( although some structure did begin to show through )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Some volatility , and all over the place on the nose and palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It did come together more with time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Gummy nose , merlot - style sweetness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good wine , but not in a style I was expecting ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Hot on the palate , but good balance with some maturity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** This has a Rhonish air to it , feels quite young , but it is also a bit simple ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Liquorice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fruit beginning to dry out ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Good sweetly fragranced wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drink now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** A big nose of public swimming pools - bizarre ( some might say funky )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very vinous - Burgundy with bubbles , to some extent and so a bit much in some ways ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I suspect it needs time to mellow - it will be interesting to see how this develops ( this bottle was disgorged only last year )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="If all goes well ***(*) All quite refined and delicate , appley pinot fruit , autolytic flavours ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Another fairly recent disgorgement after 4 years in cellars ( credit the producer for an excellent back label ), it just seems a bit lacking in intensity despite the obvious quality ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Perhaps this will develop but for now a good *** Good fruit - nice acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty intense although it seems quite evolved for a young wine - I fear it may go down the Ozzy route of rather early flabby kerosene flavours ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Curiously Sauvignon - like - quite rich ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Odd balance - people were saying this is a vineyard Huet took on and then abandoned ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good wine but it doesn ' t seem to have the class of their major wines ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A low **(*) Pretty nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Clean , rich , yet decently taught ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A credit to the appelation ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** A weak cork and a rather oxidised bottle - one sips for a while but then abandons it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I have had much better ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Very light and delicate - decent but a bit attenuated ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I have had better bottles ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Dry , savoury , quite succulent ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasantly high - toned , nervy , and a bit awkward ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A wine with a sense of place and hence enjoyable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Curiously quiet , but concentration and fruit quality are all there ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Maybe just in a dull phase - perhaps it would have shown better decanted and allowed a little air ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Leafy , dry , decent balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good wine but I doubt it ' s going anywhere much ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasant , and perhaps it would reward further attention ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Quite baked , decent concentration - slightly hot finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I recall having had better from this producer ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Refined , smooth sweet ( to a controlled extent ) - very drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Forward fruit but with the balance to hold it - the best of the New World reds , to my palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Huge monster - alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I find this a bit much ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit and to be a substantial wine in its way , although I find it hard to decide about it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Many will admire this , and I may too given time to consider it - I had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Odd balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** A bit stinky at first - resolves - tar roses but the common old Barolo oxidativeness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Tarry - quite hard work ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Clean , pretty dry , but low on real concentration ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A respectable No Stars Clean again , clearly rather dilute , quite leafy and a touch of ( not necessarily bad ) green - ness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Again a respectable No Stars Each done as a vertical - single blind A slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage ( 1990 or 1996 ), possibly Krug , possibly Billecart ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely wine whatever ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch of pink on the colour - a blush to cover our blushes ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Elegant , good length and fine balanced acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A really good , cheap ( under 15 ) fizz ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Fruit is starting to dry out and a touch of volatility is appearing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** This vintage had a juiciness about the fruit that was lacking in the other wines , but was also maturing well - at an in - between phase I guess ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very classic cedary , mature Claret nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Classic on the palate too , but there is an air of living dangerously , of corruption , and a general hint that the wine will crack up ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Classic again on the nose , but a rather fresher , more stable palate with complex multi - faceted fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high - toned ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drinking well and no hurry to consume ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** This was one of three Chapel Down wines ( and a few refreshing and pleasing bottled beers ) supplied by the winery ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I don ' t get to try an awful lot of Bacchus nowadays , although way back I used to attend the English Wine Fair and try samples there ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I can ' t say I miss it much ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This wine is floral , grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon - like flavours ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Strangely for a cleanly made 11 % white wine , it isn ' t the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it ' s not unpleasant , just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Hopefully the Champagne style Pinot that was also sent will be more interesting ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Does wine travel well ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This Champagne seems to have ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Packing the car recently , I opened up one of the underfoot storage compartments to pack a bottle of fizz when I found - to my surprise - a bottle already in there ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This , I worked out , had been in the car for the last couple of months ( going everywhere the car went - a thousand miles or so - in the cold and in the warm )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Unfortunately I didn ' t have another , untravelled bottle of this around for comparsion ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely fizz , with good nutty steely age on the palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fine depth of flavour , although the palate does tire very slightly at the end ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really on very good form ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fragrant , dry palate , quite meaty and serious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Time to drink I guess - it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather enjoyable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** I don ' t often drink village Chablis ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This is a good example of what you get from a good one : all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Best with food ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Seems a bit thin and mean straight from cellar , but when it warms up its fantastic : dry and succulent but with intense strawberry fruit and a bit of beetroot in the mouth ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite structured - it will probably improve a bit yet ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Am I being overgenerous with ***(*) Quite tight and lean , I wondered a bit whether it wasn ' t a little thin when judged by the highest standards , but while not an absolute star , more and more emerged with some breathing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very well - defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Excellent concentration and balance , great fruit but bone dry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Just a lovely village wine , I thought at first - but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Top , top quality ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Creamy fruit , lean , complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Very good village wine - good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Delicious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good *** Quite rich , forward , exotic fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drinking nicely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight , and then thawed - didn ' t seem to have done much damage , and as my host remarked it ' s an easy way of opening the bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Pure , quite mineral , the fact that this is a &quot; no new oak &quot; wine very pleasingly evident ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite a lot of richness to the fruit too , specially once it had been open for half an hour ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Understated , quite complex , but a little flat and dominated by a caramel / toffee overlay that I ' m not keen on ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Being a Tempier fan I was expecting a lot from this , but on this showing I ' m not wildly keen ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Dull , very deep - coloured and tending to oxidation ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nothing like a couple of other halves of this from the same lot which were lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="An early case of &quot; poxy white Burgundy &quot; or just a dodgy cork ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Attractive and drinkable , but lacking the mineral complexity of the Launois NV drunk recently ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Pleasant mature rieslong - needing drinking fairly soon ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Writing up my notes from visiting D - J in Rully persuaded me to open this , brought back from their cellars ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bright , attractive and authentic , but lacking any special buzz ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Long and delicious , provided you like the meaty , not so elegant , Bollinger style - it ' s not everyones glass of bubbles ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Pretty good ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Top ** Pure , luscious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not really a keeper on this showing ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Fragrant nose with a tar underlay ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="High - toned , pure yet quite gutsy tannins too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Persistent on the finish with chocolatey notes ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It ' s pretty tightly wound still and a bit enigmatic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="My guess is a bare ***(*)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Clean , dry , attractive ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very pure , high - toned yet silky fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Somewhat in the Burgundian style but with roses , tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe Nebbiolo tannins ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="On the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper old - fashioned Bordeaux ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so well - made it is a pleasure to drink now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Perhaps starting to tire a bit nice fruit , quite dry - seeming now with a bit of Pfalzy weight and a hint of hardness ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Yeasty , quite meaty ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="( A quick thrash onGoogle reveals this one some sort of IWC trophy - I can understand that .)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not entirely my sort of thing but still perhaps worth a bare ***(*) Iodine and iron , rich , decadent , fleshy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fruitcake fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good , and time to drink ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ****" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Tight acidity , fine and intense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' ve been a bit up - and - down about this wine but I ' m sure I like this bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Perhaps even **** Quite big , a touch flabby , rather evolved and vegetal ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m not sure what combination of producer , vintage and possibly premature oxidation accounts for this , being unfamiliar with the first two factors in this case ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still pretty drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Lightweight , feminine and fragrant although with quite a hard core running through it that suggests drinking with food ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Modest acidity , and so I am not sure how long this is for keeping ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very pleasant but without real distinction at the highest level ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Not very striking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Herby nose , quite tight and nicely balanced for the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Juicy , succulent , a touch of minerality ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good : drinking but will probably improve a bit yet ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** An attractive combionation of piquant high - toned fruit with a lovely rounded ripeness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good - for drinking over the next few years , I think ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** ( Domaine de la Bon Gran ) Rather rich , touch of botrytis probably , pretty good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Really nice - quite forward as the producers wines tend to be , quite big but in balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="No hint of the problems of the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** The second bottle of H . Lignier 1er cru from this vintage I have tried recently ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This is so pure , digestible and generally fine , but understated - it doesn ' t shout and it doesn ' t have a particular note of individuality for me ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Yet it is a complete wine that I like a lot ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Beginning to drink well , but not a long - haul wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Notably off - dry still , very fresh with rounded , attractive fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Lovely apple and cream nose , slightly honied and a touch of yeast ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fine mousse too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A 93 / 94 / 95 blend I believe ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top **** That old Rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical - lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very fresh , nicely rounded fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Ultimately I suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Good intensity , the fruit has a distinct character : mineral , not fruit - driven , something almost secondary about what is surely primary fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very engaging ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Very gentle , completely resolved , pleasantly enjoyable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** All very lovely , but despite the deftness of the touch of new barriques , I feel it lacks the crystaline purity of his other wines ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** An enigma : that slightly &quot; flat &quot; souuthern - French palate , but with air an engaging herby nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Is it going anywhere ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m not sure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Lovely cherry fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very attractive ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Good Syrah character , fruit - driven but not to the point of undrinkability ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Scrapes ** Substantial and weighty , notable botrytis , interesting palate but perhaps tending towards rustic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This was just a taste - I ' d be interested to try more ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Fruit still has a lot of primary blackcurrant but the structure seems resolved so I guess this is for drinking now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Creamy , some cigar - box , all in all attractive fruit , but a little too undemanding to rate a really high score ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** I guess I could get used to this trocken business : this has good fruit and is bone - dry without being harsh ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still fairly moderate alcohol at 12 %, the overall balance is good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A year or two short of its peak , I suspect ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Blackberry fruit , some oak I think - quite tannic perhaps from the oak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Modern - style ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** An interesting expression of the Langhe , if with a modern tinge of new oak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Everything Conterno makes iselegan and drinkable and this is no exception ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="On the other hand I can ' t feel it is ultimately distinguished in the way that his Barolos are ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A mix of four grape varietoes including Nebbiolo ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Round berry fruit , quite a lot of blackcurrant , some tobacco ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very nice mature Claret , if tending slightly towards the rustic - lacks the fineness of a top wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good though ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Quite spritzy initially but the next day that had dissipated and the honeysuckle Soave charcter and pure fruit very evident ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good length too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top **(*) This is better every time I try it - class will out and I think it is Le Mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Delicious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** My last bottle of this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It ' s really a relaxed , fully mature , attractive and balanced wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that I remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 12 . 5 % alcohol ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very classy , pure , blackberry and apple fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Demanding but ripe tannins , very succulent ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really good Dolcetto ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Spritzy from dissolved CO2 I guess ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent richness of fruit , intensity and length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice sweetness balanced by really good acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="At least ***(*) Lovely bright appetising Mosel wine , yet with a rich fruitiness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very attractive ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** The second time I ' ve tried this recently ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It ' s an Ozzie - like Cabernet Syrah blend but with a very unozzie dry palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Seems to get better the longer it is open ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fine wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** A dry dark Oloroso - like palate - what a P . C ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="ought to have I guess but I often find them more Amontillado there too as well as on the nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="15 years old according to their web site ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Spicy riesling petrolly nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty dry - good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But fairly simple and light ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Again petrolly - rather richer ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite good concentration ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Dry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I wonder how this will go given it is already so petrolly ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Honey and caramel ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Butter ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Less intense on the palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good ** Less ambitious and benefits from that - in fact reasonably concentrated and intense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Unusually intense vanilla nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Damp straw - quite heavy - textured ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Honied and rich ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Charred nose and oily fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Big and long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Impressive in its way ( which is not my way )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Berry nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Oddly rasping finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Minty ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Similar - finishes a bit abruptly ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Minty ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bit toffeed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="High - toned ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m not wild about this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Liquor blackberries ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Medium - weight palate - oddly bitter finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Might be going to be rather good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="( I keep getting this wine in situations where I can ' t sit back , drink a couple of glasses and think about it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I must try and do that at some point .)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Dry , pure , well - made ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Balanced ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Liquour raspberry again ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bit thick ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Softer and lacking the attack of the 2001 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Hints at mint again ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Oddly twisty ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Yet more balanced than the Chileans ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Quite fresh , fruity , straw - like ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="High - toned ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Pleasant and gracefully old - perhaps going a bit flat ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** I spent the day moving paving slabs ( heavy and intense ) and making fish stock ( light and intense )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The stock was poured over some cod , sea bass , spinach and creme fraiche ( this isn ' t Fine Wine Dairy , but it does pay to get decent creme fraiche ) and then baked in the oven with a little grated parmesan ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Stroganoff , excellent cheeses from the Cambridge Cheese Company and a passion fruit tart from Maison Blanc in Oxford ( that my daughter was very passionate about ) followed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good fizz which is perhaps just beginning to tire ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Medium weight and with a hint of oxidation ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Rather simple after the de Venoge - lighter weight ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Some complexity emerges after a while in the glass ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** This was the sort of bottle you would avoid even on the most generous of bin - end offers : the label stained and some evidence that the wine was seeping through the cork and dribbling down the capsule ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="However , the wine inside was lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This was as tight a Riesling as you could hope to taste with classic minerality and finely tuned acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A really fine effort with time ahead ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) One of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Glorious sweet St Julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="None of the Â  typical Talbot whiff of the barnyard ' that Broadbent notes , but rather , on this showing , a wine of great purity and lasting structure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Superb , and at a glorious peak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** From magnum ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I guess this was always going to be a come down after the previous wine ( I rather naughtily tasted them in this order when others at the table were more conventional in their drinking order )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This is reliable stuff that is drinking well with its tarry , coffee and chocolate overtones ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good claret that , enjoyable though it is ( I am drinking it whilst typing these notes ), gets relegated , for now , to the luncheon division ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good *** From a half ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Delicious and aging rather well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good apricoty acidity and with a sweetness that is verging on being oversweet , but which is contained within the framework of the wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I think this will age into something truly great ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Showing its age with a tendency towards maderisation but very drinkable with yeasty rich fruit and good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Like a Viognier almost , nicely intense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Pure black - cherry fruit in profusion ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good concentration and so on , with a slightly cassis character that seems quite common in modern wines ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="How will this age I wonder ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Probably quite well although the whole package is a bit soft for my taste ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Fragrant , lightweight ( a very poor vintage of course ), no very great length , needs drinking soon but it still has lovely minerality and is very stylish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Meatier , longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Again so individual and so much a terroir wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I love it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Backward , dense but fragrant and long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Coming towards peak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) This has rather a baked fruit character that I am not so keen on ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It is hard to taste against great wines like the Gentaz , but only a top ** Fragrant , dry and long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="More mineral and complex than the other Ogier wines ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really lovely and should be drunk on its own away from the Gentaz wines that tend to upstage it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** An absolute star that could even benefit from another year or two ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Tremendous weight , and concentrated minerality but all in balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fantastic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***** Needs a swirl or two in the glass but characteristic Cote Rotie violets emerge ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** This has a solid core of fruit , and the minerality and complexity that all the wines possess ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It is a touch harder and a touch less strong all round than the 89 however ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***** Fragrant , balanced , easy - going wine with a nice dry finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good *** Corked ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Awkwardly dry and rather short ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Would go down quite well with food perhaps but not great - hardly surprising given the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Asian spices ( as R . P ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="so often says )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fresh ( almost youthful still ) with fantastically long fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Gorgeous ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***** Oxidised - might be an odd bottle so I won ' t rate it but of course at this age from this vintage they might all be this way ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated More awkward than the 85 - it lacks that wines easy balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Intellectual wine and really good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** More open and leafy , lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Top stuff but a little flabby and keroseney for a special cuvee from this producer ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Mineral , broad , intense with a restrained , crystalline purity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Brilliant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*****" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pale tangerine colour in a decanter ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Intensely gingery on the nose ( as Ramonet ' s wines often are ) but to a grotesque degree ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather horrible palate - probably just oxidised but in a rather odd way ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A day later the oxidation aspect less apparent but still extravagently gingery and with a dull flatness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="No Stars Much more what one expects - plenty of acid , quite juicy , nice fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Quite leafy liquid tobacco ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This seems to have gone backwards a bit since I last tasted it - clearly needs a few years but good drinking now too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="According to the front label ' An original blend of 95 % SYRAH '; according to the back label a ' wonderful accompaniment to chicken dishes , goat ' s cheese tart or full flavoured cheeses ' and ' Suitable for vegetarians and vegans '." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Unlike the labelling , the wine isn ' t too contrived ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good balance and good red fruit depth ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It will probably improve with a few years age ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="By the way , the other 5 % is Mouvedre [ sic ]." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Just **(*) I wasn ' t expecting much of this - Sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white Rhones ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="What a revelation though !" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A wine I could drink and drink - and not just on Sundays ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good old fizz with touches of honey , wood and aniseed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** A disappointing wine in some sense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite winey , and doesn ' t really have the class one expects ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Relatively ( for a big name from ' 96 ) rather simple and lacking the drama and complexity of something to tuck away for the future ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Possibly an off form bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**(*)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Exotic , rich , old - fashioned ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Splendid ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Peachy , exotic , quite evolved ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Made to drink fairly young , but has that Grand Cru something about it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** So floral , pure and beautiful ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Intense , dry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Approachable but lots of underlying structure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Completely gorgeous ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*****(*) Mineral , very attractive , drinking nicely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Rounder and a bit more concentrated ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Mineral finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still fairly young ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Much more reserved ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Dense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very concentrated - more balanced than the 90 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Brilliant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(**) Leaner , sea breezes ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very classic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="( In time the 89 will be the better wine I guess .)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) Lighter nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Edgy finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not a bad 78 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Not edgy like the last time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Piquant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Complex ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very classic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** Thanks to everybody for bringing interesting and enjoyable wines , and to Centotre for feeding us well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Dry , rich , appetising ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I feel a bit of barrique aging is aiming at an international market , but it is good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' d like to sit down and drink a few glasses one evening ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Maybe even scrapes *** Quite Burgundian weight ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Oaky ( but quite well handled ) Chardonnay ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Classy - needs time though ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I find the Tunina a bit more individual but this is pretty good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) As usual , a melange of flavours ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Delicious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Turkish Delight ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Dry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Could be a bit tiring although perhaps Gewurz is ever that way ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice balance of rose - scented fruit with a dry palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Another wine I ' dlike to try &quot; properly &quot;." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good *** Big - scaled wine - top Chianti as I ' d expect from this wine in such a fine vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) Stinky at first - blows off to reveal a really good taught , balanced wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather good , I think ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) Herby ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Suave , silky , dry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite structured ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Easy **(*) A bit dry - might improve but seems a bit austere ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But rather a nice nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**(*) Scented nose but tannic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Serious , I find the new oak tannins a bit more difficult young than the traditional style ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But the oak is done well and terroir shows through ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="I feel I ' ve had slightly better bottles of this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** More body but perhaps a touch less well delineated than the Sandrone ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very nice approaching maturity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** So delicate , mineral , fine and long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Just ready ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** A bit extracted and a bitter for my palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not my sort of thing , although there ' s alot of wine in the glass ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Dry , juicy , mineral , nicely made ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) A bit more modern - styled ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasantly creamy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Good farmyardy , mature Burgundy - quite piquant and perhaps a touch rough with marked tannins ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice drinking but fades a little in the glass ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Rather dilute , dull and uninteresting ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Past it - horrible ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="No Stars A bit tough and tannic , but with good texture ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Could do with a bit more fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="More drinkable than I thought it would be ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not a star village , an un - rated vineyard and a moderate vintage - it ' s amazing what sensitive winemaking can achieve ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely , drinkable , engaging , characterful and not entirely simple fuit - nine years old and about at peak from a half ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really very enjoyable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Dense colour ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite Syrah - like at first , but more baked ( almost burnt ) plum fruit after a while ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good texture - feels nice in the mouth ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good structure too - this is a rather good , characterful wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still improving and needing time , but perhaps it won ' t actually quite rate more stars ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Really quite youthful still , high - toned food wine with a touch of ( very Italian ) bitterness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I described this as &quot; modern &quot; last time I drank it , but it isn ' t evolving quickly ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Merits *** A big hit of blackcurrant on the nose initially - and a while after it still has quite a lot of forward fruit , at least compared to the more austere higher - toned 94 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still a fine wine but I ' m having trouble getting to grips with it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Say , *** Lovely high - toned brambly fruit with a touch of cranberry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good ripeness and succulent tannins , nice mineral base too - probably still improving and could even rate another star in time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="For now a top *** My last bottle of this : rich and flavoursome with highly evolved fruit - on my first sip I thought it was past its best , but on longer acquaintance I felt it was about at its best while needing drinking relatively soon ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Healthy colour - cedary , fruitcake nose and a pleasantly balanced palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty much at peak , but holding nicely - a bit of air and it opens up and reveals a fragrant side too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I haven ' t always been overwhelmed by the wines from this estate , but this has shifted my opinion up a bit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very pleasantly cedary , but this Bordeaux - style wine ' s fruit is becoming a bit thin now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** My last bottle of this : lemony vanilla , touch of sherry character but completely and enjoyably fresh and appetising ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Almost timeless , but I guess it wouldn ' t improve ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very pleasant mature wine ( of an unfashionable sort )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Scented , dry and savoury - old - fashioned Claret that isn ' t that weighty ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very pleasant , but I think perhaps not one of the best wines from this property - it is still improving but may not rate more stars ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** I haven ' t tasted this for eight years , I think ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich , extravagently viscous texture ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="There ' s a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very lovely , but I have slight reservations about the complexity - it does seem , as one might perhaps expect from the grape , a touch one - dimensional given its other qualities ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** My first sampling of Jadot ' s Beaujolais project ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="My first thought was that I was expecting something a bit larger , but the fruit has good , under - stated concentration and there is an attractive mineral core too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very drinkable , yet there is a tannic underpinning that will give a at least a few years of positive evolution ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I am quite positive about htis - for now a conservative **(*) Lovely , intense , Grenache - based wine - long , balanced , like a very good Chateauneuf ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Easy top *** The Lamaione is a disappointing wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I remember having it for the fist time ( before FWD , in 1995 or earlier I guess )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Then it oozed class , and in 1997 I still rated it highly ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But since then it has declined , and now one word will do : ' undrinkable ' - although I ' ve expanded slightly beyond that below ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making ( carb ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="mac .?)." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="There aren ' t many wines I ' ve poured down the sink , but this was one of them ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Harsh and astringent ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Completely gone ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="No Stars I don ' t want to be unfair to this wine ( it was a quick replacement for the undrinkable Lamaione ), but this isn ' t quite of the standard that previous vintages of this wine used to be - although , possibly , it is just a bit closed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* A really good bottle of this wine - it seems in the past to have varied between 3 and 4 stars ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This one had the good strawberry leather nose of the best bottles ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Leathery , rustic and farmyardy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not the most elagent wine ever , but it never has been ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Just ****" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Touch of toast , nice middle of the road Champagne palate , medium weight , decent finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Quite vinous nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Chewy palate with some obvious wood influence ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Elegant , ripe apples , fine , long finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent fine mousse ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not universally enjoyed , perhpas becaus it could do with some time in bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I like the style though ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Scrapes **** Seems good but very slightly tainted - corked maybe , but perhaps in fact excess sulphur ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Takes the edge off ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Dry , fragrant , nice balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very toasty - one gets used to it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very tightly elegant and fine but it lacks sensory oomph a bit even though it is seriously concentrated ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Loses fizz quite quickly ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I have slightly mixed feelings about this but maybe it needs further study ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top **** Quite full - bodied - a touch rustic perhaps ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="There is something of Macon - with - bubbles about it but nevertheless it ' s very drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good *** Some lovely wine , but also some disappointments ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' ve had Talbot , Gruaud Larose and Las Cases 1982 in the last few months , and whilst the first two have been stunning ; the last one is not showing well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely together fizz - good acidity - elegant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Delicious weighty wine with a good , heavy acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Stunning ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** Lovely Riesling nose - elegant palate - acidity variable , but the wine isn ' t getting flabby ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Good wine with food ( garlic and chilli prawns ), but a bit simple ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Dry finish - unknit - not really clear whether it has a direction ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Dusty and drying out ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Good but closed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**(*) Drinking beautifully ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Easily the claret of the evening for drinking now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Textbook Pauillac at a peak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Disappointing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch volatile at the end ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Weighty , but it should be better than this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Good wine which others preferred more than me ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Big and balanced ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** From a half ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good botrytis , but the acidity is lacking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Too heavily sweet for my tastes ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The last time I had this , in 2002 , it seemed a weedy wine that probably wasn ' t going to live to its youthful potential ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It just had the odd glimpse suggesting it might improve - but I wasn ' t that convinced ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fortunately though , this bottle at least is on lovely form ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A dry wine without flashiness , but lovely toned acidity and flavours that are constantly developing in the glass ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="And to think that I almost decided to drink all my bottles in 2002 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="An easy **** Holding up well , but so dull compared with the Chateauneuf above ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Simple sweet flavours ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I suppose ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Attractive nutty ( marzipan ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="), tangy nose , very nicely - textured palate with solid underlying fruit and a lovely salty finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="All quite refined ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Maybe scrapes **** Not what I expected on opening , oddly rounded fruit and a tired feeling ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="After a while though it opens up quite nicely : bone - dry , savoury , citric , a touch of herbs and a hint of Fino Sherry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very nice and perhaps will even improve ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="For now *** Very luxurious agreeable Oloroso that slips down a treat without generating the last word in excitement although its nose is pretty complex at least soon after opening ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Say *** This wine has a touch of the lifted salty tang of Manzanilla over a burnt old - wine palate with a long finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very mouthwatering , a touch of camphor or something ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Seems almost better after a day or two open ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Easy **** Very fine and long - tangy , hints of chocolate almost on the nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not quite as demanding as the Coliseo from this house but very fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Very drinkabe old sherry , grippy and with that nice hint of sourness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not the last word in fineness however - I feel this hints a bit at dry - cleaning fluid ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Rich and long with rather greater depth than a standard Fino - salty tang too , nice acidity and a long , citric finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very clean and pure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not quite one thing or the other if you know what I mean ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Vibrant ripe fruit to start with but with a green and dilute finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not as interesting as I would have hoped ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good fruit but perhaps a touch rustic - old straw farmyard characters of a pleasant sort ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Completely mature and very drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Forgiving it a certain rusticity one might stretch to **** Warm and ripe ( the vintage I guess ) but perhaps beginning to lose it in a graceful way ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Cedary but not terribly complex ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Seems pretty much ready to drink - nice balance , generous fruit and a nice dry finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Lovely appetising , drinkable wine ( breaking for another mouthful as I type )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not a hint of the varietal flab , yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Something of almonds about the whole package too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This has the balance to keep well for a while I feel , and it may even improve over a year or so ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Dry yet not austere , and with really good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Classy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Clean , fresh and simple wine with lightweight raspberry fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** A touch oxidised , but I couldn ' t decide whether this was the winemaking or a duff bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="So , until I get to try it again Not Rated" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="From a magnum ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good sweet fruit , chocolate and coffee ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good balance for drinking now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bone dry and with good intensity and length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It just seems to lack a bit of pizzaz - the whole effect is a touch ( but just a touch ) flat ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Silky - textured and rich , one feels this wine is part of the transition to a modern style here ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But this has produced a fine wine in this vintage , voluptuous , but still with enough stuffing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Nice mature riesling nose - completely resolved and really quite soft and lovable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** I have mixed feelings about this : on the plus side , fine nettle - like fruit , nicely balanced , now mature with a decent finish and a streak of minerality ; on the minus side a slight lack of real presence , just a little underwhelming considering the reputation of the producer ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Scrapes *** It ' s easy to scoff at Musar , and until today I hadn ' t opened one of my own bottles for a year or two , but it ' s really not half bad you know ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rustic , yes - ultimately fairly simple , yes - but it does have lovely round , sweet , leathery fruit and it has aged very gracefully to a soft , amber - edged maturity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="So it ' s easy to scoff in the other sense too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Some will say this is past its peak but I rather like it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Mature riesling apricot flavours , old wine roundedness , very pleasant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Quite big , ripe and sweet for spatlese ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very attractive , quite forward and engaging fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good rather than really riveting ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Quite big , ripe and rich ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This has a timeless quality - while showing some mature characters it is still quite sweet and very fresh - it will benefit from more time in bottle I think and will probably merit 4 stars in the long run ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Impressive ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Remeniscent of a top Rhone Grenache : high - toned , a touch medicinal ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This is really good wine - intense fruit but a nice balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** This has now opened up nicely - gorgeous long , mouthfilling greengage fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It was so tight a few years ago and it has been fascinating to watch its progress ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It is bone dry and has that Wachau sternness that ( slightly to my surprise ) I am often a bit ambivalent about ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This though is drinking so nicely - perhaps it ' s just a mistage to try and drink these wines young ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very top *** This seems to have become a touch more piquant and high - toned than I recall ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A grown - up ' s wine with tanins that might never be entirely mellow until too late , and a classic Claret nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="top *** Sherberty , very open fruit , and very pleasantly drinkable at 8 % alcohol ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bit spritzy at first and ever so slightly hollow on the palate , if I was going to criticise ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="On the other hand , it has a lovely long finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Ready to drink I guess , but no great hurry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Raspberry fruit , nodding at cassis also , dry , very firm as this producers wines tend to be - still a touch hard ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very nice village wine coming round as it approaches its 10th birthday ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Rather nice - intense grapefruity riesling , with something towards nectarine on a persistant finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Seems quite dry to me for a classic - style Rheingau but that may partly be the particularly good acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drinking nicely but no hurry to consume - might even be better in a few years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** A high - toned wine from this most European - styled of Californian winemakers , with rich yet piquant fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This will improve a bit I suspect but needs the right food ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Seven year - old Soave ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The fruit is now rather evolved - peach kernels and almonds , but still fresh and with a hint of floral notes on the nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Some will say this is past its best but I like it a lot ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Dry , attractive , drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good *** Dry , yet with with very nicely - textured fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bargain at well the right side of a tenner ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Pleasant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Nice example , without any great extra complexity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top **" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Red Burgundy Wine as it helpfully says on the label ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather dilute and lacking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Possibly just too old ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Sweeter fruit than the above , and with a simple charm ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But hard work finding much flavour ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** A bit unripe on the palate , and with coarse fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Some ( pleasant ) signs of maturity on the nose , but not coordinated with the rest of the wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Easily the best of the recent Pinots that I ' ve had ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch stewed , but at least not suffering the dilute characters of the two French wines ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Medium depth , well put together for early drinking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Reasonably taut ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Charming for early drinking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Occasional glimpses of bacon fat and raspberry , but some coarseness and awkwardness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** A slight spritz on opening ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lihtly honeyed and with hints of blanched almonds ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Sherberty rich , drinking very nicely as it has for a while and will for a few years yet ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Long and delicious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Rounded , forward fruit - pleasant but ultimately fairly simple ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Rather overwrought - huge alcohol - rather flabby fruit ( although superficially there ' s decent acidity )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A substantial wine that perhaps I just wasn ' t in the mood for ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Gamy , rustic , high - quality fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Interesting , quite complex , characterful ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Guessed this might be Swan ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Good fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nicely balanced ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good concentration ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good *** Baked , tarry fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very tannic - serious ( perhaps overly so )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Others will admire this more than me ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Jammy , solid , quite raisiny ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very substantial wine - I find it a touch heavy going at the moment ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I suspect it will improve and be rather impressive ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Just beginning to drink well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Good *** Very dark colour ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very marmaladey ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Ultimately not so complex and clearly upstaged by the Filhot ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Quite high - toned ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Grippy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A very good wine for the property ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Very pruney and rich ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really appealing fruit with some hot edges ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Probably for drinking now , and pretty pleasant in its way ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** A bit drier and more mainstream ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still a shade closed , very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Possibly seems a bit older than it is ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good acidity and some tannin at the end of a fairly full bodied , old - fashioned entrance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Needs some time to resolve itself ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) More floral and open than the last bottle I had of this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Well made fizz for drinking young ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Fairly vinous and with good , sharply focused acidity at the end ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A champagne that tastes like a good young fizzy Burgundy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This needs time , and could be stunning ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(**) Possibly not in the best of condition compared with a recent bottle that Toby had ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The flavours are a bit dull and it is more oxiidative than might be expected ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Weighty , meaty nose - autolytic plus apples ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Similarly with the palate , but not at the expense of balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Apples again , a suggestion of tannins ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Long , quite complex , perhaps a touch young - I ' m sure a year or two in cellar will be beneficial ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Scrapes ***(*) Really quite forward - touch of vanilla - long and enjoyable but doesn ' t seem to have the guts to be a real keeper ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Only a year or two delayed versus the standard vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still very fresh , nutty and autolytic - really yeasty on the nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drier and tighter than the GA 97 too - lower dosage probably and perhaps the vintage too ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Fragrant , mellow , eminently drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fresh but a suspicion of drying at the end suggests this is not for keeping beyond another five or so years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** High - toned , a bit of cranberry , a touch of underlying meatiness and excellent fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely but without the va - va - voom of the Combe aux Moins from the same producer and vintage tasted recently ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still scrapes ***(*) Lively , quite complex , proper tarry Barolo and more or less &quot; a point &quot;." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="It has a deep colour ( from skin contact , I think ) and a broad , flat , mouthfilling palate after a honeysuckle nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It reminds me a bit of one or two other Italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction : Massa Vecchia and Gravner ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It is rather less grand than either ( and a bit cheaper ) but I like it , and I think time is making it more interesting ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Intense strawberry nose , solid , concentrated fruit , quite dry as often with Lafarge ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Quite good of its sort ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Fragrant , elegant fruit - lots of underlying tannins ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fairly modern - styled ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Needs a few years and on the way up but perhaps not beyond a good *** Rounded , suave fruit , some tannins but would be fine with food ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Silky , Burgundian but structured ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very fine but I sometimes feel Sandrone ' s wines are a bit of a trick - almost too polished ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) A touch larger and richer I think ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Like the La Vigne , modern - style but without excessive oak influence ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Nicely poised , splendid balance , clean and pure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Sophisticated wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Nicely done , although to my taste it might be better without the barriques ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Pure , very restrained varietal statement ( a plus point )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top * Richer - 2003 was very warm here too I think ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Similar quality ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top * An exotic blend of Chardonnay , Sauvignon blanc and Pinot Grigio I think - rather nicely constructed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A wine that I would like to sit down and try properly - I suspect it would repay scrutiny and so let ' s say *** Lovely texture , lovely fruit , nice acidity and length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** I don ' t taste a lot of young Tokaji - this though seems very promising ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Top *** Raspberry and chocolate fruit - a lesser vintage that you could almost drink now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Aniseed , baked fruit , very dense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I hardly ever drink young port but I am sure this will be very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**(**) Intense , sweet blackberry nose and concentrated palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very much new - wave Rioja ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good , yes ( very good in its way ) - interesting , less so at least to me ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Higher toned and with very evident tannins , but very much in the same style ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Seriously pricey - same as a bottle of Rioja Alta ' s famous 890 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Give me the latter any day ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Curious - it seems to have old - fashioned touches of volatility but generally a modern style ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Reliable Ridge - pretty good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Classic - quite Bordeaux on the nose but with an extra ripeness even more evident on the palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still , quite classically styled and very fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) At Nahm Restaurant at the Halkin Hotel in London ( very good food by the way ) with a Thai meal ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Unpleasant nose of a really odd and undescribable sort ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Blows off to a large extent , but still Not Rated Slightly sulphury - clean palate tight , quite long ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Pretty fine but I have reservations about the gluey component ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Could do with a year or two ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Slightly sweeter style ( dessert rather than aperetif ) - but reasonable acid balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice grapey fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Apricot jam - quite a lot of botrytis - modest acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Decent rather than excellent length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Perfectly nice but a bit simple for a top wine - unless it is in a quiet phase ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bare **(*) Very honey and orange peel - pretty sweet - modest acidity - and so a little cloying ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Might come in to better balance in time but I ' m not sure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="May be just a bit overdone ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not quite my style , but *** Lots of apricot , coconut , banana , and exotic fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Big and rich yet so complex ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely and will be great ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) Limey - seems lightweight at first but that ' s probably just following Yquem ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="** All wines drunk at Crantock Bay Hotel overlooking the bay during an enjoyable family holiday ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Modern Chianti for drinking young ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Easy , clean Burgundy without huge depth but with purity of fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** An intersting comparsion wine to the earlier Chianti ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This is more robust and has a slight bitterness to the fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Holding up well , and probalbly needs more time ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Very graceful , almondy nose - slightly floral , but pleasingly free of overt varietal statement ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="( I think it ' s a blend of various varieties , for what it ' s worth .)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="On the palate , completely balanced with perfect acidity and a touch of ripe lemon around a concentrated but understated palate ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Stony , meaty rather than elegant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty nice but not out of this world ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Good colour , black - cherry nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fruit quite baked in character and at first it seems to have a hole in the mid - palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But that seemed to fill in once the bottle had been open a while ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Top stuff ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) A long maceration job , in the style of Gravner , but from Garganega from Gambellara just outside Soave ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Long finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Will probably benefit from a year or two in bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Lead pencil nose - a fair amount of new oak I suspect ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fairly lightweight and elegant - perhaps to excess ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not like Jasmin of old ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Could do with a year or two ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Decent balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Vanilla - weight of a traditional wine - but the fruit quite bright and fresh cherry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Worth ** Talento is apparantly a trademark of a consortium of growers in Northern Italy making Methode Champenoise fizz from mainly Champagne grapes ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Still a touch hard on the palate , bone dry with quite a lot of tannin ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="**** Chestnut , coffee , lovely ripe fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite fresh and fruity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still well - structured but drinking well - no hurry to drink this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** A little difficult at first ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Then rounded Christmas - cake fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Less exotic than the 85 and more 1 - dimensional ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Frizzante , only 6 . 5 % alcohol , pleasantly refreshing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather like a Moscato but floral rather than grapey ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Ideal for sunny garden evenings ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Well made ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Rather good fruit , oak fairly evident on the palate but probably not excessive ( although I must say I like less and less oak in my wines ), quite mineral too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Could do with a bit longer in bottle but probably won ' t make four stars as it seems just a bit simple by the highest standards ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** It ' s sad , but Waitrose is much better than any previous source of fruit and veg in the city ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Toffee and caramel , quite maderised and a bit vegetal but maintaining interest and drinkability despite being past its best ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I oscillate between finding this too far - gone and admiring it ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Intense - lots of fruit almost obscuring lots of botrytis ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rich and very good - ****(*) Quite liquoricey , sweet - spirit a bit disjoint currently - raisiny fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Extravagantly sweet ripe ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice but suspect balance to me currently - it might well improve ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) The friends very kindly came with two bottles of Champagne - one a back - up bottle in case the main one wasn ' t showing well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Possibly just past its peak , but a nice wine for those who like their Champagne old ( which I do )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="OK , 1990 isn ' t that old , but this isn ' t the greatest name in Champagne either ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good , slightly oxidised maturity with the 1990s softness evident ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="I had it last in 1999 , when it was disappointing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This time though it was a glorious claret with warm , pencil - shaving nose and palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m glad I ' ve resited its calling until now because this bottle was caught at its best ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="There is a touch of weediness ( well it ' s not the best vintage ever ), but the balance is fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This is the sort of wine that makes keeping fine wine so satisfying ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I could drink a lot of this , alas though this was my last bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A charming **** A coarser wine than the Pichon above , with higher toned acidity and a more granular structure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good , pleasant wine that held its own ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good , solid *** From a half ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Marmalade nose , and a waxy , lanolin palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bit simple possibly , but showing rather nicely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I can ' t usually get too excited about Sancerre , but this is rather enjoyable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It has enough age to have lost its initial zing , but still has a pleasing balance of fruit , acid and honeyed , grassy flavours ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** This is Syrah , Garnacha and Tempranillo in the ratio 7 : 2 : 1 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Modern wine , but well made with a dryness of fruit balanced by good tannins ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bit closed at present I feel , but it probably has some potential ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A cautious **(*)" sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Good stuff ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Opened with trepidation given Toby ' s recent article ablout 1996 white Burgundy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This one , however , was fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Elegant , light to medium bodied and with good use of oak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good texture to the wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Possibly needs more time in bottle to be at its absolute best ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** I don ' t know whether to score this wine or not ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="When first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="However , returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present , but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I am now drinking the rest of the bottle as I type ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Again , when I first took the cork out ( a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night ) a corky edge lurked within the wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But it disappeared !" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="As had the oxidised edge !" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The wine I am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold ( see the note for Pichon ' 92 below )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But this wine seems to be living in reverse ( if I left it another few days I ' d probably end up with a bunch of grapes )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine ( they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when I poured the last glass from the bottle )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Scored as it is now drinking : top *** Beginning to tire - fruit oxidising ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drinkable , but not for too much longer ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** A joy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not a wine that needs too much thinking about , but delivers what is expected of a decent twenty - year - old Pauillac ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Elegance and grace , and with the clarety minerality of age ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="At peak , I think , but no rush to drink up ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** I have quite a lot of this wine , and I have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether I needed to rush to drink it up ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="On this bottle ' s showing , I need not have too many worries about that ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not quite up to the standard of the previous wine ( it somehow lacks the breeding ), but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="No rush to drink up ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** A bottle opened the night before which LJM brought round on the off chance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Alas , not really fair to judge this wine in such condition ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="So I won ' t score ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="** More age than others - a touch tarry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not quite together ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But OK . *** From a half - I think ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Tasted (?)" sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Mineral , dry , fairly austere , quite flavoury ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Quite forward - eminently approachable already ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Authentic Burgundy fruit , decent acidity and a sophisticated creaminess to the texture - all very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It seemed to lack a measure of intensity , particularly late on the palate - it seems to fail to be either properly intellectual or properly hedonistic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good wine , for drinking over the next couple of years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Genuine chalky minerality and , once it has opened up , rich ( but not excessively so ) nectarine - kernel fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice acidity and good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Starting to drink quite well now but no hurry to consume ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Delicious - and nosign of the problems thatplague the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) Rich and full , fairly advanced ( as the wines from this producer often are ) but no sign of the premature oxidation tha plagues the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="There ' s a bitter edge to the fruit that stops me giving the highest rating - it ' s a funny thing , bitterness : sometimes it seems an asset to a wine sometimes a problem ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Herby - quite complex ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still quite tannic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="As Paolo de Marchi remarked , there can be a problem with Sangiovese of the fruit maturing before the tannins ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Lovely concentration ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="One of those wines that is just bordering on the past it , but is still pleasant and intersting to drink : it ' s possibly just that bit too oxidised , but this has given it a nutty character ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="A prestige cuvee that lives up the billing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely drinking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Easy **** Could do with another year or so to mellow , but this is nicely structured fizz with floral aromas and refined , appley pinot fruit ( it ' s a BdN , I believe ) with overtones of white chocolate ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Top *** A blend of grapes from 89 , 90 and 91 - Cuvee 5 , disgorged March 04 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fresh bread and apple nose , rich full yeasty and meaty palate ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="My impression is that while very good there ' s no extra depth of character apparent from its &quot; single vineyard &quot; status ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A prestige cuvee I ' ll try again but I won ' t be rushing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Unpleasantly oxidised ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I hope this is an odd bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated A half , opened rather soon after shipping ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Seemed confected and estery at first , quite citric but with decent concentration ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I think this is better than it initially seems ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Let ' s say it is scraping *** White bread and currants on the nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Light to medium weight - elegant fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite a lot of Meunier - which shows slightly negatively on the palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good but could one ask for slightly more intensity without sacrificing the elegance ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m not sure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m being critical - but this is very nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="( 2001 plus reserve wines - disgorged June 2004 - I like the informative back - label )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very top *** Rich nose - chocolate , yeast , dense fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite a weighty , vinous palate - perhaps a bit heavy at the moment and perhaps rather wood - influenced , but this might mellow with a year or two in bottle into something very fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Might even rate another star in its way but for now *** Touch of white bread but mainly ripe Granny Smith apples on the nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty decent basic NV ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Perfectly pleasant but a bit nondescript ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This has aged OK without really developing in an interesting way ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** This is rather dominated by farmyard straw on the nose an palate - too rustic for me in a way that I don ' t think will improve with age ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="OK , but no more than that ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** 100 % old - vine Pinot Meunier and thus interesting ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Floral and perhaps floury ( or am I being influenced by the name of the grape ) fruit , quite forward in the mouth and a bit colourless on the mid - palate with an ordinary finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Real Champagne balance ( quite dry ) makes it pretty drinkable however , although it is hard to find much real complexity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="An oddity that is worth trying , particularly if one wants to get a grip on the grape and what it might contribute to wines like Moet NV , for instance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Scrapes *** Quite autolytic , appley fruit , complex an honied , quite dry and with good pinot gutsiness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="All this after seeming a bit maderised at first , but as often with Champagne this seemed to blow off ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Citric , appley nose with yeasty notes - quite complex ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Ripe , rounded fruit despite the excellent acidity of the vintage - needs a bit more time though - aspects of it seem quite tightly wound still ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite long too and creamy textured ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) Light to medium weight , elegant , complex and nutty , quite long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Just occasionally it seems a little oily / keroseney on the palate but that may be the food I am having with it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really pretty good , although probably for drinking over the next couple of years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good deal from Oddbins at not muchover Ł20 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** A bit coarse on first sip , but this seems less noticable afterwards ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The fruit quality is a way short of Champagne so a fairly basic wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasnat enough ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* One of those evenings with a lot of corked and oxidised bottles - even before I arrived there had been some bad whites !" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Last taste from a nearly exhhuasted bottle ( I arrived late )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Seemed typically lovely ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="**** Slightly corky ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Completely shot - oxidised ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Gamy , warm berries , very pleasant - typical mature Beaucastel of this period ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Substantial but rather oxidised Not Rated To make up for the corked Rhones !" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Touch of game , lovely ripe fruit , quite low acid ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Chocolate , cherries , strawberries , easy , rich yet appealing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely complex palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really , really top Port ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****** Complete wine - really pretty good but so upstaged by the Niepoort ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) Mainly from my own cellar , tasted in the last month or two Quite mineral , but this seems a bit flabbier , flatter and lacking freshness than I remember ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I could worry that we have a touch of premature - oxidation disease here although the wine is perfectly drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I hope it ' s an odd bottle , the one I had in July 2004 was fine and I ' ve had a couple since which I did not note because they were similar ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Nice fruit , very drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite luscious even with a richness that one might attribute to the standing of the vineyard ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good balance too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But nice though it is , I find it rather undemanding - no tautness , no succulence , in short no really grown - up qualities ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' d hope for more excitment from this vineyard ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still a fine drink , and it doesn ' t sell for huge money either ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** A bottle drunk over two evenings as opposed to my last notr from the middle of a wine dinner ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bright and attractive raspberry , cranberry and beetroot Pinot - a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very pleasant drinking but not profound ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a long - term wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very ( excessively even ) citric , good acidity and a modest finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="No sign of 96 oxidation ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I was given this knowing only that it was a 96 white Burgundy - thought it might be a disappointing grander wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Actually this is rather good for its level ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** On first opening , bright , high - toned , delciously fruity - mainly red fruits - and with good balance and length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very quaffable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Later , some minerality appears too and it seems stylish too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very nice indeed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Probably for drinking over the next few years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A very top *** Even with decanting , still quite hard and needing food ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Stylish - I hope it will resolve well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** A bit reductive at first , opens out to reveal strong high - toned fruit and a bit of pinot animality ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch hard at the moment , particularly without food , but pretty good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Splendidly mineral and delicious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** One bottle rather orange an unpalatable - oxidized Burgundy syndrome , I fear ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Another quite mature and hinting at the same but still rather good and pleasantly drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The good one : ** Fresh strawberry fruit , moderate acidity , some tannins and still quite firm although the acidity is moderate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Opens out nicely overnight but still has a twist of bitterness at the end of the palate that I have mixed feelings about ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Bone - dry , austere at first but then just very classic appetising white Burgundy at peak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** The Champagne was the last wine of the dinner , and very good it was too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very elegant - specially considering this is blanc de noirs ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Dry yet very appetizing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) Quite fine - creamy but a little sweet - lacks minerality and steelyness ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Dumb - or not quite right - could even be the early stages of premature oxidation ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Tight , dry Meursault nuttyness , lovely acid , touch of lemon ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Very fine , balanced , complex ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Intense , very long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still improving ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** Gamy , nice ruit , earthy , nice but not so long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very pleasant mature wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Ravishingly gorgeous , elegant , fragrant fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very lovely , if a little light and perhaps no more than it ought to be for a Grand Cru ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Some want to keep this for 10 years and ( probably ) good it will be in rather a different way , but I love it now too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** Lovely mushroomy nose , perfectly fresh , nicely dry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Ripe but with excellent acidity and good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** Creamy and mineral ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent **** Very mineral , stony and dry , lemony , intense , very Raveneau ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Starting to drink well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Delicate , fragrant , almost floral ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Medium - weight palate , succulent tannins gives some bite on the finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Very evolved colour ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Open nose , rich , hinting at corruption ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Slightly open palate that puts me off , but classy irony hints are rather lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ****" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bit grassy and cloying on the finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I enjoyed this at The Square in London a while ago but it seems a bit dull this time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Bright , clean , nice pure fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice acidity - mouthwatering ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Scrapes **(*) One bottle a bit cooked and plummy , another brighter and fresher with good density of fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not , I suppose the finest or most complex fruit , but nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The better one a bare *** Quite rustic , light - bodied but quite intense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Characterful ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Quite leesy and rich - Chassagne - like ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch showy perhaps ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Nice tone , appetising ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Friends brought this round for lunch ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely medium weight Burgundy with touches of toffee , nuts and melon ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good to have a wine that doesn ' t seem sterile in its freshness and isn ' t trying to be any more than it should be ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** And here ' s the coincidence ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I just happened to drag this out of the racks in preparation for the same lunch ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This , as one would expect , has more signs of age - there ' s also a slight dirtiness / stalkiness to the wine ( again none of that sterility that can make some modern wine so boring )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good maturing Burgundy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** This wine has been a bit of an enigma over the years - Toby and I have both given varying reports ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This bottle , however , was exactly what it should be ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fresh and vibrant , sweet strawberry and beetroot , and with good acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="More than pleasant ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Bare **(*) Added complexity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fine length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**(*) Restrained - gives the impression of being a bit less complex - or is it just a bit closed ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **(*) The nightmare vintage - this is quite restrained to the point that I worry a bit about its weight ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It ' s retained some good Puligny character though ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Pure Pinot - simple but nicely balanced ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely , classic Bordeaux nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bright fruit , but a very odd , harsh , late - palate and a slightly hot finish that leaves bitterness in the mouth ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="*** Very nice - mineral , classic Claret ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely balance right through ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="For drinking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Medium weight with a lovely savoury palate and a touch ( not unpleasant now they are resolved ) of the vintages tannins ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I like this a lot - probably has more time left than the 81 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Very nicely classic ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="High - toned again ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really splendid but still needs time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*****(*) Classic , quite austrere and high toned - very 66 ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Top **** Corked ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Hopelessly oxidised - surely an odd bottle ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Much more classic than the 90 - dry , flavoury with marked tannins ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="My impression is that while very good this won ' t become a star like the 70 or 61 - it seems a touch lighter ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Exotic coconut nose , creamy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Claret as we know it , but fascinating ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="There ' s great depth and structure and so this probably will be stunning in a while ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ****(*) Young wine cassis - but Montrose minerality too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fairly ripe - it seems in a slightly softer more modern style than the later wines in this flight ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good though ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Liquid minerals and excellent fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good and will be lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Very dense - a cross between 98 and 90 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Qute a monster , but perhaps some of the older wines were that way in their youth ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still , this will surely be lovely in ten years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(**) Mineral again but a bit more restrained and classic - less exotic than the 96 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I like it a lot - almost more than the 96 - very stylish and balanced ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Very nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="At least *** The usual zoo - bottles everywhere , great fun ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The notes are consequently quite brief and impressionistic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice nose but rather off - dry on the palate - spoils a nice wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** A domaine in Quintaine ( Macon )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Charming and easy - in the best sort of way ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A great advert for basic Burgundy ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="**** Grenache - ripe - luscious ( nice vintage , I suppose )." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="It has the structure ( some tannins ) and balance to improve ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) A little diffuse on the nose by comparison - there ' s some extra complexity from the odd mix of grapes involved , but I feel that is superficial and I prefer the honied purity of the Ribolla ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent again ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Honied nectarine again , excellent but lacking the depth of the 1999 - also perhaps a touch &quot; flatter &quot;." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still exciting ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Interesting , fine flavours - again a lot less weighty than the 1999 ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="*** Fantastic texture and density , really good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="So suave ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="Bare *** Lighter , but with some extra spice ." sensical="true" />

  <utterance text="I have since discovered from the nice people at Gosset that it is a 93 + 94 + 95 blend ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and I suppose it is although I don ' t find it remotely a problem ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very rich but now in perfect balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Quitelarge - framed , a bit coarse and difficult towards the finish - perhaps a year in bottle would help ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Ok , but I ' m not wild about this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="From a half ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Doughy but floral nose , quite tight , dry and precise , elegant palate - decent length but with a touch of hardness that needs a year or two ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) Lost in my filing system - this is from dinner at a BYO restaurant a few months ago , but I can ' t recall when ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Mainstream Chassagne ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pretty good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** A bit woody - extravagent oak as often with Grivot ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Dry and austerely planky ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m not so keen - others may like more ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Very pleasant gamy old thing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drink soon ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Oozes minerality , approachable but time will doubtless improve this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rasins , a touch of oxidation , sweet pruney palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="OK but unremarkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Lightweight , almondy , quite fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Picquant and medicinal ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Attractive as a lunchtime port !" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good *** Elegant , lightweight , fresh and bright ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Very pale - the colour has dropped out as sediment ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Madeira - like nose , pleasant port palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Quite pale , rather eveloved ( the level is bottom - shoulder which might be the reason )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather savoury and delicious but not quite what it ought to be , I feel ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Very pale , mushrooms and biscuits ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Probably very old ( some paper labels claim some of these bottles as 1850 ' s - if any are , it ' s this one ) and past its best ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** From different source and showing up all the previous wines ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely graceful old wine , fruity and scented , still fresh ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It develops in the glass and is completely delicious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***** Nutty , yeasty , lovely mature Champagne ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***** Quite forward , slightly fat 98 style ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Completely healthy but for drinking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Mineral , clear , fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A stunning effort for the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top **** Still a touch hard but very fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) Probably substantially North African !" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Lovely mature Claret ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Perhaps even a bare **** Dry , very smoky , quite baked fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Seems younger than its years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) Gummy , quite intense , in - your - face stuff ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Rounded , very deeply coloured ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Very rancio , cloudy ( and still so the next day )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rich and thick and with something of Ozzie liquor Muscat about it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Curious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Yeasty , very nice - Champagne quality although different in character ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Tight , lovely , classic white Burgundy ***(*) Rather evolved - creamy marzipan ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good but might have been better a few years ago ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Very much real wine , this oozes strength and individuality ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Might well improve further ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Makes an interesting comparison with the Roda : I prefer this because its much less international ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good *** Cassisy , peppery fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather international , but good of its sort ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very classic , dry , tannic , high - toned ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Rich fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Elegant - seems rather good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="( This wine passed me by a bit - I think I was chatting too much and concentrating not enough - my main memory is jsut that it was very good .)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still , ***(*) Spicey , rich , very M - C . *** Elegant , lovely balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Class always tells ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **** Very marmaladey , soft , delicious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I need to think more about this - is it Tokay somehow as it should be , or is it turned into something else for the modern market ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m not sure yet , and I need to drink a couple of glasses more contemplatively ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still , it ' s at least very impressive ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nicely shaped bottle , and reasobale stuff inside it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bit coarse and woody , and a bit too sweet ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**(*) I think I ' ve had this for a few years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It ' s certainly worth keeping ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely honeyed and mineral palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A joy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Just goes to show that you shouldn ' t rush drinking Champagne !" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** OK , but nothing out of the ordinary ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** I haven ' t had Koonunga Hill for ages ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I was pleasantly surprised ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very Penfolds in style ( no bad thing to my mind ) - velvety smooth , not trying to be too big , gentle on the head ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Good nose , but not typical ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A really very coarse palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather fine fruit with just a touch of lychee - not very varietal now , more mineral - some will say too old but I think its at a peak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasingly dry too - quite a fine wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Is this just age or is this old - style Zind before the days of extra residual sugar ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Whatever , it ' s rather nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Tarry , fragrant , everything you could want from a typical , good Barolo in a decent but not special vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Needs drinking in the next few years ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Rather deliciously smooth and fragrantly , softly Volnay ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I noted after a while that this had been tarted up with quite a lot of new oak ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good of its kind , and quite good even in absolute terms ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Lovely old - wine nose , fresh fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Coarsened after 30 minutes or so and faded a bit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still rather pleasant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="No indication on this half as to whether this was a Riserva or anything ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Nicely made , fruity but not vulgar ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ** No excessive 2003 flab although I ' d like a bit more precision and minerality ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Decent wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Excellent fruit , especially given the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Gamy and mineral ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A lovely mouthful but the finish is a touch harsh ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still **** Nice weight , attractive fruit but it seemed a bit flabby - maybe just a touch warm ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Creamy , fragrant , delicate , quite fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Butterscotch background to greengage fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Completely fresh with a long finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="( Magnum ) ***** Excellent - tropical - edged very lemony fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Some oak I think ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice balance and very rich ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Big - a bit modern but very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Aiming at the Beaucastel Rousanne VV style perhaps ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very fizzy to the extent of being a fault ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But it wears off enough to form a judgement - quite mineral and characterful ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Serious wine that I ' d like to try again ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="At least a good *** Lovely , creamy , fine acidity , good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Appetizing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** A touch closed and struck matches too ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Opens out - great concentration ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A top ***(*) Nice rich fruit , dry long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="top *** Still red Pinot Noir from Champagne ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="So soft and silky ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Gorgeously round ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Easy - going ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="One of the best non - Burgundian Pinots I have tasted ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Beetroot fruit - harder than the previous wines ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very baked and extracted ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This is really not a success ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Lots of grippy tannins ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Highly - wrought and oaky ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not my sort of thing - but striking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Certainly needs time but what will happen ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very fine - deep , rich , silky with a lovely refined , dry palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Splendid for vintage , but could one regret the lack of C - R typicity ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** Rich pineapple , nice acid ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very pleasant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Lighter at the final analysis - although more mouthfilling ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ** Bright , both metaphorically and literally ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch hard on the finish still although coming round to drinking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch short of the richness you might hope for from Grahams in this vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still worth ***(*)" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Acacia , nuts ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Intense , dry , long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drinking but no hurry ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Lime , herbs , cream ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not heavy on the palate - lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top **** Big and muscular - grand cru intensity and rich finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very good ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Fragrant , piquant cranberry , yet meaty ( bovril ) nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent for the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Partly on the basis of interest - a bare **** Promoted conversation - apart from anything else putting a wax seal on an Australian wine is making a statement ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch mineral , quite complex fruit - pure too and not overstated ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Personally , I still find an overlying minty sweetness in the finish not to my taste although that might be less noticable with the right food ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Interesting wine that somebody with more of a taste for Australian style might rate a bit more ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still *** Fat , nice botrytis , a touch of paint - stripper and not so long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good ** Less intense , less flawed and follows through a bit better to the finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Nice ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Lightweight yet concentrated ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Ethereal , complex chocolatey fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** These three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that FWD isn ' t always very kind to Beaujolais ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I tasted these with LJM ( sometime contributor to FWD )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I ' m afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about Beaujolais ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="But they have persuaded me that I need to try a few more ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Earthy , fresh fruity zingy nose with a hint of vanilla - good texture on the palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="My favourite of the three wines for drinking now ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** I ' m afraid I couldn ' t really get on with this wine - it seemed light and dilute and was a touch green at the end ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Possibly a faulty bottle so I won ' t score Not Rated Quite a soft wine - maturity taking over from the earlier gamay vibrancy I guess ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Initially a bit dumb and subdued , but after time the wine opened out ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It would be interesting to try this in another couple of years to see whether it is just at a bit of an inbetween phase ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="For now ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent condition at 10 years old , very good fruit too , although for some reason I could not get that excited about it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still a decent *** My last bottle of this - and hasn ' t it kept well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Completely fresh but fully mature , quite soft and very pleasingly drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very juicy with a touch of Italianate bitterness to give it a grown - up appeal ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Finishes a touch abruptly perhaps ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good * A glass at Valvona ' s Vincafe , even so clearly very elegant , refined , blanced and generally yummy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Very classy , loads of fruit , fairly forward , drinking very nicely ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** On opening , quite tough - you have to like tannins for this ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It does have the most fantastic ripe fruit though and 24 hours after opening it had really opened out ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Delicious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Easy *** This guy is one hell of a winemaker ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This has concentrated tarry raspberry fruit on the nose , bags of tannins ( which are ripe enough to be enjoyable even at this stage ), super concentration and texture and a long finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="High - toned , despite being a bit more forward than the 96 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Easily ***(*) Written from memory a day or two later : surprisingly old - fashioned orange - rimmed colour ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite forward and easy - going , drinking OK at the moment in fact but surely more time can only improve matters ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very classy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite dry , fairly austere but very good , particularly with some nibbles ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ***(*) More forward and fragrant , not really noticably sweeter ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good *** This is half Chardonnay and half Pinot Meunier - the latter not that apparent ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very yeasty , seems a bit four - square at the moment ( perhaps that is where one sees the P - M )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rich and really very long ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Clearly need quite a lot of time , and I can see it could well be very good in a decade or so , although it might be a bit light on finesse ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare **(**) Curious - very exotic , vanillan , and highly vinous ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not everyones idea of Champagne , but you can ' t say it lacks character ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I need to drink this over an evening ( with food ) and see how my relationship with it develops ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="For now a top *** Dry , real Puligny , quite intense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not special but it does what it says on the tin ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Quite rich , mouthfilling wine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lacks the classic finesse that marks out the stars ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Nice fruit - pure , intense ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** A bit more oaky - but quality fruit again ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Seepage round the cork ( under the capsule )." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Odd but not undrinkable - clearly faulty ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not Rated Depths , depths and more depths ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Really lovely , both rich and piquant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very top ***(*) Burnt , dense , exotic , meaty ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Tannic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Austere , difficult ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="This might yet come good , and even now it is arresting and interesting drinking ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Risky to rely on it evolving well , but if all goes well ***(*) Attractive green rim - never a bad sign ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="On the palate , like a really fine old Madeira in every way except there is not the real intensity or searing acidity on the palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The flavours however are very fine and this is a lovely drink ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Chocolatey fruit - very nice old Colheita ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Possibly a touch too old now , but lovely old Champagne nonetheless ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Mature and elegant for its depth ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** One of the first wines I bought with a view to keeping ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="I love old white Burgundy , and this didn ' t let me down ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely , oily , nutty ethereal stuff ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Disappointing ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Not past it , but just not particularly special ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Maybe it still needs loads more time to develop ?" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Lovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drinking very well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Silky ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***** OK , so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The label wasn ' t in the best condition ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The next morning I was just sorting through the corks when I noticed we had really been drinking the 1982 ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="The last time I had this wine I was disappointed , and I was again this time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It ' s OK , but it hasn ' t got the structure or depth expected ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Stylish nose , slightly resinous - a bit thin on the palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasant ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Slightly flat , flavoursome , a bit rustic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Interesting , up to a point ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Rich fruit ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Lovely Burgundy ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good intensity and structure ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Needs time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***(*) Mothbally at first ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Disjointed but intense palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Emerges - needs time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Will be great I suspect ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(**) Honied nose , strong palate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Quite evolved - ready in fact and needing drinking over the next few years , I suspect ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Even unflawed 96 ' s seem to be aging quite quickly ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Open , peachy , luxurious ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A little light , some thought , but I loved it ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** Cough - sweet and smoky ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Interesting , but slightly harsh on the finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="perhaps needs time ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Grenachey , cassis overtones - quite raw finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A bit rubbery ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="** Caramel nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A touch rough , perhaps ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Opens out - quite classically chateauneuf ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Nice balance , clearly warm - vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A lovely balance of slavours ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Coming round to drinking quite fast ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A good **** Yummy drinkability ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Stands up in this company - if a bit simple ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Fragrant nose ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Gummy , rich , very fine ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="**** A touch woody ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasant , persistent , but perhaps a bit thin ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare *** Burnt , a bit thin ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Bare ** Fragrant fruit , a touch hard , a touch of aniseed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="fairly lightweight ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top ***" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="My memory of vintages of this Provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good : Provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very much a point and it has kept well ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="A little simple perhaps but I believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good effort - I ' d like to try some other vintages ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Quite concentrated and flavoursome , but lacking finesse for me in a way that I ' m not sure more time will alleviate ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="PLeasant then but not fantastic ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Smoke and pepper - fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Blackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones - once open for a few hours , very stylish indeed ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Will probably improve for a year or two ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** A bit stinky on opening - it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Still , quite a dense , brown - sugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good rather than exceptional ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** Fruity , grassy - like a new world semillon ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Pleasant enough ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="* Nice fruit quality - quite suave ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Decent length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top * Very fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Very refined texture and good length ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Once it has been open a while it seems even more Burgundian ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="It needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Scrapes **** Slate , sherbert , a touch sour as MSR wines can be ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good length , maybe a touch hollow in the middle - something I find occasionally with the vintage ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Fine , but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Top *** Quite tight and closed , but opens out with time as it warms up ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent intensity and a long brioche finish ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Good balance ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="****(*) Very thin and dull ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Drinkable but No Stars" sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Modern - styled , but very nicely done ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Limey acidity ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Satisfying , but completely upstaged by the Jobard that follows ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="*** More reserved , but much more complexity and &quot; beyond - fruit &quot; flavours ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Excellent ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="***(*) Dry , reserved , quite persistent ." sensical="true" />
  <utterance text="Rather good ." sensical="true" />
